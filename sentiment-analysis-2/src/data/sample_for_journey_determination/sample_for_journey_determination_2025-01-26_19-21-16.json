Dashing us off to Rome to catch a later plane , was the most dangerous driving ever witnessed, whereupon arrival in Rome with the gate closing, the Rome crew knew nothing of our dilemma & we nearly missed the flight, just no communication between Florence & Rome BA.Despite 3 weeks passing by , BA have not responded to x6 emails & despite them giving out forms all completed re the compensation offered, they are totally ignoring us.My years of loyalty to BA is waining thin.what does one have to do to have them respond?"

Less than an hour's flights to and from Brussels, Iwas really thirsty and thinking of buying water on board but I was pleasantly surprised! Spring water and brownies offered. Not much but something. That's all I needed, water and it was nice to get it for free. Comfortable seats, flights departed on time, all good.

We had to change arrangement so my husband went to SF with a car and I had to change to see family in Boston a few weeks late. I was told by BA customer service it was best to cancel and rebook for the best fare since both my husband and I had already paid \u00a3150 change/cancelation and rebooked. The time on my new flight was wrong flight (economy out, premuim return) and I needed to depart earlier on the same day or even the day before. After 10 hours of calls over 3 weeks, they accepted to make the change with the Dr's letter but the fee went from \u00a38.00 to 974. Customer service is not in the UK and have no authority. Very disappointed with BA over the last 3 years and will get the courage to move to another airline (24 year loyal customer)"

The lady didn`t do anything to help me, my questions regarding how long it will take, where to contact the customer service etc. was not answered. She just gave me an information sheet on \"What to do if a flight is canceled or delayed\", which was not even related to my issue. I have no claim number to check and after calling at BA baggage service at 03444930785 they told me that no new claim on my missing baggage has been made. I AM REALLY ANGRY! Not that they dont take this matter seriously, I waited half an hour in the general customer line to be told no one can help me there and then I was given a phone number to their baggage service. I hope my bag turns up, but this last desaster of many spilled the overfull glass."

On 9th Dec 2023 @ 12:54 We called the BA team (option 1-1-3) to obtain ticket for my infant from LHR to HKG (confirmation no.

However, we were told that this is our only option. We made the purchase at the end (confirmation no.

The team did not add my infant to our existing booking, but instead, made a new booking. As a result, my partner (Mr. David Michael Collier) has 2 tickets on that flight (one with confirmation no. WACULZ, one with confirmation no. VS9LSO) I then finally managed to purchase a seat for my infant in the same booking, the price was one tenth what was quoted to me just under an hour ago. I was told to call the Change Booking Department (option 1-1-2) to cancel the incorrect ticket. On 15th Dec 2023 @ 12:35 We called the Change Booking Department (option 1-1-2) to cancel the incorrect ticket. Was told that they cannot cancel my ticket.\n\nAs the result of BA\u2019s inadequate training, this lost both me and my partner over 1 day of our time.

I originally booked my flights in February, I paid a premium to book with BA as I believed that I would receive a premium product. The cost of two return flights with BA was \u00a3680, economy, but with extra leg room on both legs. I could have booked flights with Ryanair for \u00a3340. After already rescheduling once already due to a previous cancellation by BA (which cost me extra) I have been forced to cancel the flights entirely as BAs remaining options aren't even close to being workable for me.

    "reviewDescription": "What a terrible airline British Airways has become.\nI used to think they were a gold standard airline, but several negative experiences with them have certainly changed my opinion.\nThe journey giving cause for this review will be the last with BA.\nMy 3 year old grandson has dual nationality GBR/USA. His parents are not together so he had been staying in the UK with his British family for 11 months. I was travelling alone with him to take him back to ORD from MAN airport via LHR.\nI was issued the boarding passes for the 2 flights when we checked in at MAN. I only noticed just before boarding at MAN that on our long haul flight I was seated on row 40 with my grandson on row 28.\nI spoke to crew as we boarded the MAN to LHR flight & was told no problem just go to customer service at T5 & they would change our seats.\nI went straight to the service desk when we landed & queued for ages. I was unfortunate to get the most obstructive employee who questioned me at great length about the circumstances of my journey. She queried if I had permission to travel with my grandson (which I understand) and I produced many documents to prove my relationship to my grandson along with 2 letters of consent to travel, one from his dad, one from his mum.\nThis woman would not accept the letter from my son as it was not witnessed by a solicitor. Nor would she let me contact my son on what\u2019s app to verify what I was saying. She said I needed to get a letter that was witnessed by a solicitor and until I had that we would be red listed from travelling! Getting this letter would not be easy at 1pm on a Saturday (but we did manage it thanks to a friendly local solicitor who answered his phone out of hours). Having obtained the required letter we obtained new boarding passes but had to travel 24 hours later, resulting in additional expenses and we had to pay for a hotel room for a night which we did not use. Altogether a very traumatic experience on what was already an emotional trip.\nI have complained to BA about this, along with another ongoing complaint about mis-selling of tickets (which has been ongoing since January 2023) and await their response.\nFor these reasons I will avoid travelling with BA and would urge anyone else to consider carefully before flying with them."

The seats are uncomfortable, don\u2019t recline and there\u2019s not a lot of legroom, and the air was so dry I had a splitting headache after an hour.\n\nThe inflight service was a joke (a tiny pack of crisps and a minute bottle of water). The choice of stuff you can buy to eat and drink on board is dire and the pre-order selection is not much better. Honestly, they\u2019d be better off installing some vending machines.\n\nWhat are BA trying to be and what have they become? Answer, firstly I\u2019ve no idea what their aim is, but they\u2019ve become a seriously expensive version of Ryanair, but not as good.\n\nThe only plus was that the Flight Deck and Cabin crew were very professional and the landing was superb."

    "reviewDescription": "What a pity one cannot give zero stars! Arrived in Heathrow on 11th December and checked in for an onward flight to Edinburgh. Admittedly, it was foggy but they did not actually cancel our flight until we were airside. Essential to get home so took train north and were told that baggage would be forwarded. Had to speak to a real person to actually file a report re baggage. A week later, one of two cases arrived but it was not ours. So refused to accept it from the courier, who actually said it was not the first time this had happened to him. Some idiot at Heathrow had wrongly labelled it even though it did not in any way resemble the description filed with BA - wrong colour, wrong bag type, wrong receipt number. Second case arrived five days later (and it was badly damaged to the extent that it is no longer usable). We still do not have the first one. However, baggage tracing system still thinks that it was to be delivered by courier on 19th! Tracking round the BA site is tortuous and pointless. It seems to be just a circular journey. I am beginning to despair that I will ever see the case again. What makes things even more disappointing is that the two cases were checked in together and were identical even down to the same pink baggage security strap. Coupled with the quality of flight menus and cramped seating on our original outward flight two weeks earlier, even though we have been members of the Executive Club for more years than we care to think, we are vowed never to use BA again if we can avoid it."

I asked for a manager or duty manager which was denied and I was told I don't listen and when I said I'm raising my concerns I was cut off. This happened on January 16th too. I called to use my Avios points to book business class flights as I did before but this time my accounts blocked for no reason and it can't be reset apparently. Because you ask for a manager to help your denied and it's about time these people realise that without our business they'd have no job and I'm going to look at booking with Virgin Atlantic now instead. Please please do not give this Egotistic company and CEO your business and make sure you all review with negative feedback so they finally sit up and take notice.

We still however arrived an hour before the flight was due to leave. This was despite us getting to the airport via an alternative means.\n\nThe British Airways representative at the check-in desk refused to let us check-in our bags because the gate closed early. We must have arrived minutes late. We were checked in on line the day before. She offered no assistance whatsoever to try either to get us through fast track security nor to rearrange our flights. She said we had to phone British Airways to do that. What if we did not have a phone as some older people do not? It is also impossible to phone them. I tried to phone but they had too large a volume of calls and was cut off.\n\nAfter waiting to online chat with an operator for a long time I gave up and managed to access the BA booking website. Unfortunately the next flight was unavailable and there was also no availability later in the day so we travelled back to the uk via Lufthansa to Manchester via Munich. Some distance from our target airport Newcastle Upon Tyne.\n\nThe British Airways representative at the check-in desk could have tried to help us perhaps by fast tracking us through security particularly as the flight was in an hour. It did not leave early. We checked. There is no way it was boarding an hour before take off. It was due to leave at 11 am to Heathrow and departed at 11.02. We were at the airport at 10 am.\n\nThere is also no service desk for British Airways at Brandenburg. All the other airlines have one. So there was no one to help us. This is totally unsatisfactory customer service. I went to the Lufthansa desk for help.\n\nOn arrival at the airport indeed it was difficult to find where to check-in our luggage because whilst other airline logos are clearly displayed there was no such signage for British Airways.\n\nThis caused us immense distress and inconvenience and indeed expense. We had to pay nearly \u00a3700 to get back to the UK which is an utter waste of money. We also had to get back to the north east.\n\nThe representative refusing to help us was bad enough, but her lack of compassion left much to be desired particularly as the gate was closed early."

When we booked the flight we used a card that has now expired. An ARN has been issued by BA and this number has been given to our bank. They have no record of a payment. We have continually tried to claim this amount through customer services. We have repeated the same story everytime we call them, or have been asked to called them. We will NEVER consider using BA again. We have booked a long haul flight to Australia with another airline."

    "reviewDescription": "Seemingly impossible to modify an avios car booking. No option to manage online. Called the only phone number on the email confirmation. Waited half an hour to be told it was the wrong number. I've now been waiting for 1hr on hold on the new number I was given. What an absolute joke this company has become."

    "reviewDescription": "I have never experienced such a bad customer service.\nOur flight has been cancelled. Unable to resolve through 'Manage my booking', I had to call the customer service a few time. 5 calls, now over an hour on the phone, this is still unresolved. Apparently there is glitch on the system and we have no tickets. Our 4 months old baby has been booked on a seperate flight, flying on a different day. Good one BA.\nAnother call and issue still not resolved. Incredibly frustrating!!! Customer service outsourced abroad withe no one able to deal with anything. Just people ticking boxes behind the desk."

    "reviewDescription": "BA must have the poorest information technology platform of all airlines. They do not seem able to maintain a stable platform to deliver a seamless and hassle free customer service. They probably hired the same IT-team that wrote the disastrous MCAS software for the Boeing 737-800 who\u2019s credo was \u201ccrash and burn\u201d.\nBritish Airways needs to get a grip and drag its half-assed IT system into Century 21."

    "reviewDescription": "Travelled with BA on 29/5/23 from Kingston Jamaica to London England. They claimed they had a faulty break pad on one of the wheels. BA had no back up plan. They felt it was OK to leave its passengers sitting around for 5 hours, then advised us to check in our carry on bags as we were boarding, then once on the plane advised us there would be limited service from the cabin crew due to the late hours, then to top an already terrible journey, they advised us when we landed at Gatwick after a 9hour 30 minute flight. No luggage was put on board all luggage was left in Jamaica and the luggage would not be brought back to England until Friday 2/6/23. British Airways are truly the worst Airline ever and intend to boycott them"

    "reviewDescription": "I booked a BA flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and back again and, at the same time, pre booked seats from Cape Town to Heathrow. I requested a window and aisle seat (no middle seat, just 2 seats together) and paid \u00a374 total for which I received a receipt. The receipt clearly shows Seat 44K (window) and Seat 44J (aisle). When Managing my Booking on the BA website a few days ago I checked our seats and they have been changed to a middle and window seat although the row remains the same. There are now only 2 seats together at the back of the plane which have been taken. When I first booked I had a choice of about 3 rows each side with just a window and aisle seat. I contacted BA Customer Relations who insisted the plane had not been changed and those were the seats I originally booked and blamed the incorrect wording on my receipt to a technical fault. I strongly disagree. How I now wish I had taken a screen shot of my booking. I believe I am owed a refund since they cannot offer me alternative window and aisle seats. I submitted an online BA complaints form but they directed me back to Customer Relations as they only deal with post flight complaints despite my already having told them that I contacted their customer relations team. BA have appalling customer service. This is not the first time I've had problems with them. I would not use this airline but, as far as I'm aware, they are now the only airline with direct flights from Heathrow to Cape Town."

    "reviewDescription": "Booked our flights back in February. Paid on Avios for extra legroom seats for 2 people both ways. BA emailed us confirmation. Looked toaday and thay had apparently changed the plane, not transferred our requirements ofr extra la=egroom and not notified us of the change. Paid an extra \u00a334 for seats then complained that we had to effectively pay twice for the privelege. BA cancelled the paid booking and also the seats. Trying to explain to an agent that we had already booked seats got us nowhere. Not happy."

    "reviewDescription": "Awful - The World's Leading Airline - you are having a laugh. Having allocated my family (2 kids 8 and 11) of 4 seats spread out across the plane I was forced to pay for preferred seating. The website crashed whilst doing this and BA took double AVIOS points as well as the payment. On arrival at the gate we had difficulty at every step with the airport. Turns out BA had moved our seats but not advised us and the Boarding Passes we had were wrong. Made for a very stressful outbound experience for something we had to pay extra for. Wrote to complain, not been addressed and its been over 6 weeks. They did send a reply saying \"Due to high volumes we are currently not able to reply to your email\". WHAT? They subsequently have sent holding replies saying that they will get around to answering and (I hope) returning my AVIOS points and payment for the seat booking"

    "reviewDescription": "This year I flown and have spent thousands of pounds on this arrogant scam airline, I am one world member but not restricted to BA and I had option of virgin flight going to US and any other 5* Middle Eastern carrier. I have no idea why I picked this, thinking is a standard airline and must be great. I can not list everything that had gone wrong not one flight went smoothly, they should return all that money they took from me. Everything is wrong with BA from T5 staff, onboard experience (food can be 12 hour flight or 7hr only 1 meal served, entertainment limited and basic, staff young and no idea how to speak to passengers we are not all after your free booze water is fine if that\u2019s not a great effort) and collecting baggage expect to wait hrs.I have a long list of complaints but the worst was I opened my meal I found a random PEANUT on top!!! And all those allergy announcements are just lip service going on."
