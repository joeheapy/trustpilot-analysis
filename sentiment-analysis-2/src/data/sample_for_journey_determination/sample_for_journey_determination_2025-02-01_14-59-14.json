My last change to a Business class seat from Atlanta, available on line, but I had to call the call center who by error changed the booking to Premier + without advising during the call. A week before the flight BA want \u00a33000, reduced from \u00a35000, to change the booking error they made.

We have had our flights booked with BA for 9 months (London Gatwick to Faro) and last night we received an e-mail informing us that the return flights were cancelled. No reason given, just \"hard luck, your flights are cancelled\". We tried to amend our booking online, but you can't amend 1 leg of a return trip, so it tells you to contact them - which you can't because all the phone lines don't connect to a human. The online chatbot directs you to the website, which directs you to call them, which you can't do, so you go round an round in an endless loop. In the end it was easier to cancel the entire booking and book with EasyJet. British Airways don't care about their customers, they care about getting your money, then they couldn't care less about you.

The refund value was \u00a3500 total, the cost of replacement flights both ways of over \u00a31,800.

    "reviewDescription": "Have you come across the situation that you received flight booking confirmation but actually not the case? Yes, BA gave me such a \"unique\" experience!! We traveled to Namibia 14th Aug - 27 Aug 2023 via Johannesburg. Despite a different landing time of the 1st leg outbound (1.5 hour later than confirmation email) which made us miss connection flight, we did not realise that the worst was yet to come! On way back, just a few hours before returning flight from Windhoek to Johannesburg, I realised that I could not do online check in and the leg from Windhoek to Johannesburg disappeared from my BA booking details. There is no email no text, nothing to inform us. I had to make international calls to BA and South African Airways. SAA told me that they could not see my booking at all! I was panic as it was only a few hours away to our flight! I finally got hold of BA customer service and was told they could not book me and I had to find my own way to Johannesburg...what? Why? I booked my round tickets 4 months before the trip! I called SAA again and they told me it is impossible for me to catch the transit flight from Johannesburg to London: since it will be a separate connection flight, we had to go out immigration, check in at BA counter and go through immigration again....we were soooo sick about BA and decided to buy a new return flight back transit Frankfurt with Lufthansa as they had 4 seats left that day....There was one more detail: there is no BA counter at Johannesburg airport and no sign of BA at all. If you have to do anything with BA, you have to find their agent by asking around ground staff. So basically, BA sells their product which does not exist! Yeah, we had a lot of \"fun\" that trip. Now I am in process to argue with BA about refund but guess what, their response is we can not refund because you have to follow reschedule by BA if due to any flight disruption. Wait a minute, it is not due to flight disruption as I put down clearly, it is due to BA's negligence or misconduct as a business! So clearly their relevant department does not read my complaint, does not bother to understand what was the situation. I am not surprised as they must be handling millions of odd cases! We have been a loyal customer to BA for many years but now looks like I should settle my case in court."

At the time of the check in a random selection of 2 seats on row 18 got allocated to me instead of the seats I had paid for. I tried to change them to seats originally paid for but row 8 was not even visible on the seat selection chart. I then called the customer service team who said these seats are not available anymore but I can allocate other seats of your choice (which were available to anyone who checks in 24 hours before departure). I asked for a refund for the seats that I paid for as those seats are not being allocated to me and after 28 minutes on the phone I got told that those seats are non refundable and so I can't get money back. I am extremely disappointed by such unfair business practices of BA. This is something I may have expected from some low cost airlines but not BA. For a lack of better analogy, it's like saying, you have paid for Nike shoes but they are not available so just pick any that are, but you are not getting your money back for the ones you have paid for even though they are out of stock!\n\nAbsolute cowboy service which I did not expect from BA. had better and fair policies at Ryanair, EasyJet and other so called \u201clow fare airlines\u201d."

We spent about 4 hours on a taxiway waiting for a gate to become available as the airport had closed and was full of diverted aircraft. Original arrival time into Newark was 14:55 , by now it was 21:30.\nCabin and flight crew were excellent and did everything possible to keep us comfortable. Due to the time spent on the aircraft , half of the toilets were out of order, water was running out as were snacks!!!!! The aircraft Captain actually said he was embarrassed and ashamed to have to leave us with no help.\nNo assistance for onward travel from British Airways was provided , in effect leaving us stranded late at night over 100 miles away from New York in the wrong city.\nRude and totally useless ground staff in Philadelphia wearing BA uniform were an embarrassment to Britain as they did not want to do anything to assist with sorting out the problem. Cost s of hotels were spiralling and with no help from the staff we were left to sort it out ourselves to arrange onward travel to New York. Too late to book trains so a taxi was the only option. BA first of all said that reasonable expenses would be met but have now backtracked on that by saying \u00a320 per person for meals, reasonable hotel costs with cheap onward travel all to be arranged by us.\nDid the two hour delay on the ground at Heathrow contributed to our late arrival to Newark where we would have arrived before the storm started?\nCost of taxi to final destination was less than values Captain and email quoted as equivalent compensation.\nWe finally got to our hotel at 0130 the next day.

If you are suffering such a large amount of complaints take on more staff and have a good look at yourselves.\n"

My flight from Heathrow to Pisa took off 2hrs 40mins late. I\u2019d prepaid for car hire at Pisa, but by the time we got there, the car hire office was closed. Stranded at Pisa Airport with a severely sight impaired wife.

I\u2019m \u00a31000 down and nobody gives a flying fig.

The advice was just check their website to rebook or claim a refund. Three weeks before I was supposed to fly out, a refund was of no use due to expensive accommodation bookings. The only flight on offer was 24 hours later. When rebooking, they even made me pay for seat selection again when I had already done this on the original booking. This was later refunded.\nOn my return home I lodged a claim for reimbursement of additional expenses, hotel. food and taxis but the website is not easy to navigate to find out what they pay and how to lodge the claim.\n10 weeks later the status of the claim is simply ''received'' in other words no-one has progressed the claim. 10 weeks of inaction.\nGeneral customer service cannot access the claims process, all they say is that the team are very busy. They cannot provide a contact number to speak to the team so the customer is left entirely frustrated at the complete lack of customer service and accountability.\nLike some of the other contributers, I think I have made my last booking with BA.\n"

    "reviewDescription": "What a pity one cannot give zero stars! Arrived in Heathrow on 11th December and checked in for an onward flight to Edinburgh. Admittedly, it was foggy but they did not actually cancel our flight until we were airside. Essential to get home so took train north and were told that baggage would be forwarded. Had to speak to a real person to actually file a report re baggage. A week later, one of two cases arrived but it was not ours. So refused to accept it from the courier, who actually said it was not the first time this had happened to him. Some idiot at Heathrow had wrongly labelled it even though it did not in any way resemble the description filed with BA - wrong colour, wrong bag type, wrong receipt number. Second case arrived five days later (and it was badly damaged to the extent that it is no longer usable). We still do not have the first one. However, baggage tracing system still thinks that it was to be delivered by courier on 19th! Tracking round the BA site is tortuous and pointless. It seems to be just a circular journey. I am beginning to despair that I will ever see the case again. What makes things even more disappointing is that the two cases were checked in together and were identical even down to the same pink baggage security strap. Coupled with the quality of flight menus and cramped seating on our original outward flight two weeks earlier, even though we have been members of the Executive Club for more years than we care to think, we are vowed never to use BA again if we can avoid it."

For Business Class. The queues for Economy weaved round the departures hall but amongst the sea of whirling screens and closed lanes, it still took 20 minutes and some kettling for those who had paid serious money or were foolish, captive regulars to get to baggage check. The man at baggage check smiled when i suggested this was sub optimal and thanked me for my joke. The bags were checked and new boarding passes issued. I had been moved seats, closer to the front. As we headed to Fortnums to spend some money, i asked my wife whether her seat had changed too. It hadn't. I checked my new boarding pass again. It was for a different name and a different destination. Bizarrely it had worked at security as did my wife who, it turned out, was using my boarding pass. It crossed my mind that i and or my bag might not be able to get to Brindisi and so i sought assistance. I finally tracked down a \"Customer Experience Lead\" who, to be fair, worked hard to move the bag to the correct flight and reissued new boarding passes for me and my wife. Armed with these new boarding passes in correct names, we both passed through the automated boarding gates. I had thought that we were being tracked through the airport for, amongst other things, security purposes. But now i am not sure. Both our documented identities had changed twice from correct to wrong to correct on this passage through Heathrow but at no point had these changes impeded our progress. I shall ask the appropriate people the appropriate questions on my return!"

    "reviewDescription": "As always an exemplary pleasure to fly with BA, prompt boarding, flight attendance, provision and services as per usual.\nBA1334, left a little late, due to congestion at Heathrow but made up for lost time in the air. Baggage services struggled to keep up with the ship shape readiness of the flight crew and steward staff. Great service on board, attentive in the air and proactive with due care and attention upon takeoff and landing, great connectivity throughout, staff showed an especially personal touch, in keeping with BA\u2019s name and reputation\nGreat flight as always, keep up the good work British airways Joie de vivre\nMerry Christmas and Happy new year.

    "reviewDescription": "Sad to write this. Trying to book my first post-Covid trip, impossible to find out where I can fly to from Heathrow on which days.\n\nI'm asking search engines for any day in a specific month, direct flight from Heathrow. I get wrong airports, multiple stops, wrong dates.\n\nBA impossible to contact online, just phone, phone, phone. I want to see my options clearly laid out visually so I can choose, not blethered at breakneck speed by someone whose accent is so thick I can barely understand a word.\n\nNo e-mail address, no online contact form, even an email to the Chief Customer Officer went unanswered. Social media messaging just connects to a useless bot and cycles round pages of useless FAQ's.\n\nAs a result, my expensive airfare next month has gone to a competitor.\n\nWhat a mess, does BA really hate its customers so much?"

    "reviewDescription": "Awful experience, cancelled our return flight and left us stranded. Seeking compensation that they're avoiding now too! I will NEVER fly with them again EVER. Been a 10 year customer of theirs too. Rest of the group will do the same. Seeking airhelp online lawyers to claim from them now."

    "reviewDescription": "Their website and app crash so you can't check in early to select you seats. Their check in kiosks crash making you que to get bags checked and boarding pass. You can't get hold of online customer support, you call the phone number and are summarily dismissed and you have to talk them into doing their job. And their gate agents announce the boarding group then don't let you through. Your checked bags will be ruined. Dumpster fires operate with more efficiency."

    "reviewDescription": "I hope British Airways reads and passes on reviews but I am sceptical. This one is for the pilot of BA 212 departing 31/12/24 BOS-LHR. The landing on the morning of 01/01/25 at LHR was immaculate. And I mean immaculate. I have flown millions of miles. The wind was treacherous, the wings seesawing up and down right up to the moment of touchdown. The pilot timed his touch down so perfectly the wheels all touched at the same time and the plane stayed straight as an arrow (787 is not a small plane!). Barely felt a thing. No bumps at all.\n\nPilots do not get enough credit. This Captain executed to a standard he should be proud of.\n\nBritish Airways have ruined their product over the past decade and have hurt their staff with contract changes, however they manage to retain well educated, well spoken and highly competent pilots. Well done and thank you to our pilot."

    "reviewDescription": "I bought tickets with BA trusting them that I could use a voucher any time if my plans changed. Guess what? The voucher codes BA gave me don't work. I've been trying to call them for months, at times staying over three hours on the phone, and no one answers. When someone does answer, they tell me I need to speak to someone else... who does not answer. I've tried writing: they do respond, and tell me to call. It's ridiculously infuriating. I'm not asking for a favour. That is MY money. Why does BA refuse to let me use it?"

    "reviewDescription": "We were due to fly from Manchester to New York via Heathrow on 27 December. The flight from Manchester was delayed by nearly 4 hours. Given the number of people who were flying on to Newark, BA should have delayed that flight to enable people to transfer. All it needed was a 20 to 30 minute delay to get people through. Of course, that was beyond BA and trying to sort out an onward flight was a very painful experience. BA staff at Heathrow had no idea what to do. As national carriers go, BA must be the worst and we will never travel with them again."

    "reviewDescription": "During a period of poor weather 6th Jan 2025 ( this is me being generous ) - although the flight was not disrupted - I flew from NCL to LHR arriving on time and made my way to the baggage reclaim hall in T5.\n\nI had made sure that I had sufficient time to catch my connecting flight from T2, which I fly regularly each month, upon arrival I was forced to wait 2 1/2 hours for my bags to come from the carousel.\n\nI approached the baggage service desk and was told that we are busy, it's very busy and nothing can be done.\n\nI made my way to T2 after eventually getting my bag but I had missed my connection, I had to book an alternative flight to reach my destination, book a hotel for the night, feed myself and travel to and from the hotel I had to book all because because of BA I had missed my connecting flight.\n\nI was dismissed from BA service desk as \"they couldn't help me because I wasn't flying with a partner airline\" and upon contacting them through their complaints/claims channel I have not received any response whatsoever!\n\nAbsolutely atrocious customer experience!"

    "reviewDescription": "I had booked two business class tickets on British Airways between Heathrow and Cairo I bought them five months ago paid in full and arrived at the airport to see that my seat was business class my partners was put in economy, despite the fact they were both business class tickets . (Is it anything to do with the fact that he\u2019s black?) It is impossible to speak to British Airways office and the staff at the airport are beyond rude and this is the fourth BA flight where that I have taken in the last year and everyone there\u2019s been a problem. The fact they do not let you choose your seat when you book is very telling because you never get seated together, even if you buy the tickets for the same time. The only reason I use this appalling airline is because some of the places I go to they are the only carrier. I usually buy my tickets from Trailfinders first and business , and they have also let me down. I phoned them and they just told me there was nothing they could do, despite the fact that I paid them for these tickets\nBA customer service is a disgrace. It should be illegal for airlines to overbooked flights and to sell more tickets than they have seats"
