    "reviewDescription": "It is with great disappointment that I bring to your attention the unsatisfactory experience I had with your company and airline. Without prior notice, our holiday was abruptly canceled, causing significant inconvenience and distress. Despite spending a considerable amount of time on the phone with your \"customer\" team, I was astonishingly informed that the cancellation was initiated from our end, which is an utterly false claim.\n\nSubsequently, I diligently composed an email, presenting concrete evidence to refute their assertion. Regrettably, my efforts were met with complete silence, as no response was ever received. Consequently, I am compelled to express my profound dissatisfaction and firmly declare that I will not be engaging in any further business transactions with your company."

The food was absolutely disgusting it was like a punishment having to eat that - runny eggs, broccoli and an ultra-processed chicken sausage for breakfast? No thanks. They then ran out of all chicken options so we basically had to starve for the whole 12 hour flight. Some of the staff were nice, some were super rude and looked like they hated their job - I don\u2019t blame them to be honest.\n\nI have made a vow to myself to NEVER EVER use BA again. We will be flying with emirates next time.\n\n\nLooking at the reviews I think everyone else feels the same and BA has become the new Ryanair. Get your act together!!"

    "reviewDescription": "I'm extremely unhappy with our flight on 24/05/22 & 31/05/22 I was absolutely shocked with the way everything was on the plane.\nI recently traveled with Emirates and their service was over and beyond. I didn't want to travel with a cheaper airline like easy jet, pegasus or even Turkish airline I chose British airways even though it was way higher in price as I thought the service would match.\nI travelled with my 3 children and their father. There was no tellys on the plane and I didn't pack my kids ipads as I thought that would keep the kids busy but obviously that was not the case. Nothing as much as a colouring book was even provided for my kids aged 3, 6 and 9. They sat for 4 hours straight with nothing to do and not a single airhost went out there way to accommodate or make them feel welcome. Not even blankets offered. They were bored stiff and hungry. Yes it's a 4 hour flight however for a child that is a significant amount of time and for the price its disgusting to only give complimentary crisps and water. I also paid 7.99 on the flight back for Internet and it didn't even work for 10mins before it stopped, I asked an air hostess to help me and she said well we are in the sky flying maybe we are flying over some areas that we don't have Internet over or connection is poor ,so why is it even available as an option to purchase? If you are aware it may not even work? For you to make more money ??\nYour name doesn't match your service I'm very disheartened and definitely will not be travelling with you again or reccomending you to anyone. people should be are aware that you do 0 to accommodate children I mean its 2022 and with a name as reputable as British Airways to not even have tellys on board is quite ridiculous but also to provide small children with nothing. Literally ignore them .Not an experience I enjoyed. And 10mins after your allowed to purchase food (spend more money on board ) you were apparently sold out of most things, I geus everyone was hungry on that flight despite it being 4 hours! Give people what they pay for and stop robbing them !"

    "reviewDescription": "I agree with all those giving a 1 star review: emailed this morning that flight in 2 weeks cancelled. Followed instructions. Wasted time on phone that eventually pops up message that calls not being answered, try at a later date! This is after listening to platitudes about helping those travelling this month. Chatbot put me in touch with a person, I was 52nd in line. Half an hour to be contacted by Daniel who couldn\u2019t help so joined a queue of just 12 but it took nearly 90 minutes for Joanne to touch base. To be fair to her she sorted reasonable alternative flights in a few minutes. It should not take 2 hrs to resolve. This is on the back of flights to Seville cancelled, alternatives a day before or after were \u00a31000 more than the \u00a3500 originally paid. Still waiting for the refund 8 weeks later. At the gate at Heathrow last month when flight to Copenhagen cancelled and put on flight 8hrs later. Compensation for this has been received. I have booked on Quantas rather than BA to Oz and may take others\u2019 advice and go on EasyJet or Ryan Air. Anyone want 280,000 Avios and an Executive Club Gold Card?\n\nThe leadership of BA must consider their positions as they are clearly incapable of providing a service."

I flew back from the states last week, on a BA plane and the conditions were disgusting. A tiny plane with the most people you can uncomfortably fit in a small space. I could barely fit in the seat, let alone fit my legs in straight. I couldn't drop the tray without crushing my knees either. A few hours in, one of the staff serving smashed into my seat with his trolley, bashing against me. He looked down at me, and carried on. I called out to confront him and ask why an apology was so hard. He replied, \"this is my workspace.\" Absolutely gobsmacked that you would cause harm to customers and then shrug it off as, not my problem. I am never flying with these clowns again. Made Easyjet look like a 5 star service."

Ba told all passengers to go to terminal 3 and the plane was even not in that terminal. Then boarded the plane took off. the staff were rude to my dad because he asked for tea on the catering trolley and they only served fizzy drinks and water not hot beverages which they didn\u2019t mention so my dad waited for 10mins before he got served. Then we landed in Vegas airport and the cabin crew said \u201cif you have a connecting flight go to the British airways rep at the desk and they will get you onto the connecting flight\u201d by the time we got the bags and gone through immigration the flight had already boarded and when we got to the rep desk nobody was there so my sister and my mum tried to find people about what was going on about the connecting flight bearing in mind Ba where meant to be helping us and they did nothing at all. So we had to find a hotel and then my mum tried calling Ba to get us the next morning onto a flight to San Francisco but nobody was on the customer service line and said they were not available so we had to change the plan and move the rental car to Vegas as well as scraping the plans we had like we booked a hotel and sign in San Francisco and that was \u00a3200 gone. So thanks British Airways for running the start of my holiday I will not recommend ever flying this airline again."

    "reviewDescription": "So shocked by this airline. In all my years of flying with cheap and cheerful airlines, the irony is that when I happened to book flights as part of my package deal through BA, I made the mistake of thinking I would get a superior service. How wrong I was. This company is a complete con and if you need to change the name on your booking (to a different person), they force you to buy BRAND NEW TICKETS. First of all they tried to blame the travel agent, but no, let's be clear: the travel agent was more than happy to make the change. It is BA's policy not to allow name (person) changes. I have never had a problem in the past on the occasion that I've needed to change passenger details. BA seems to be the only airline that doesn't offer this extremely basic, simple service. It is so basic and frequently requested in fact that I'd go as far as to say it's one of the only functions a passenger needs to contact customer service about at all - so why bother offering a 'customer service' line if you have no policies in place to support the customer? Truly shocking. BA quite sinisterly term the simple procedure of changing the name on a flight as 'body swapping' and speak of it in hushed tones as if it is the most unspeakable request imaginable. Back to Easyjet I go."

About a month later, received a PAYPAL refund for a fraction of what we had to pay, around 200 pounds instead of nearly, 700! Still not able to get through.

All fine until she tried to check in 24 hours before the flight when she was told that the \u2018ticket\u2019 was still in her brother\u2019s name and she would not be able to get on the flight. Clearly a mismanagement on BA\u2019s side. It\u2019s impossible to get hold of anyone from customer services who can give any help. I was already in Crete and was repeatedly put on hold and then cut off for over 5 hours. Even though the whole mistake was BA\u2019s fault, she was told that she would have to buy a full price ticket on a different flight to her other brother, and she could not cancel her original ticket because it was in someone else\u2019s name!\nShe was extremely upset but had no choice but to go ahead.

    "reviewDescription": "We decided to change our flights to leave a few days earlier than our originally booked flight. As part of the original booking, we paid a whopping \u20a4140 to select two preferred seats. I searched and search across your website to figure out what would happen with our seats if we changed our flights and I couldn't find anything describing the policy on seat refunds. Since I had confidence in British Airways, I thought 'oh the policy shouldn't be unreasonable. I think they will honor what we've paid for seats so far and that will be applied to our seat selection.' So, I ended up making the flight change. Well, it turns out that was not the case and we were required to pay an additional \u20a4140 to select two new preferred seats on our new flight. I decided to reach out over live chat about this issue and someone explained to me that they would try to process the refund over live chat. They came back maybe 10 minutes later and said unfortunately it could not be done as per the policy - that seats are non-refundable and non-transferable if the flight change is voluntary. This is very frustrating considering how much we spent on seat selection. Not even a voucher for the equivalent cost could be issued to us, as per the customer service agent. As you can imagine, we are very upset that we have just had to forfeit a large amount of money since BA's policy is unclear and, in my experience, non-existent since I couldn't find anything when I searched for the policy on seating in the event of a change. In an ideal world, I would like a full refund for both original seat selections, but I don't know if they will honor it. My live chat agent advised me to file a formal complaint on the website so I will be doing that but this is the second time that we have experienced a major issue with BA and if this is not resolved then we will probably take extra care to never book with them again."

    "reviewDescription": "Incredibly bad customer service, I asked for a quote on flight change and they said they'd get back to me with quotes. Instead they changed my flight without telling me and refuse to honour my original flight date. Customer service is the worst I've ever experienced they never call you back."

    "reviewDescription": "Lost my luggage on flight out to NYC. I got it the day before I flew home. They lost it again on my return flight. Horrendous customer service at Heathrow Airport. Really inaccessible when trying to make contact, website is terrible to navigate. I asked for disability support, I was transferred on a flight with no support. Missed connecting flight due to delay. I could go on and on. Awful experience and ruined my trip"

    "reviewDescription": "As a less mobile person, I travel Prem class by BA since Covid out of loyalty. Unfortunately, I see BA slipping downhill. BA charges extra, extra for Prem Class but it's service is 1 star for the fare it charges passengers. The choice of meal menu is a Joke. The Prem class is a small cabin comparatively to other cabins, yet we get Leftovers after the middle row. We're offered one drink during the 14hr flt( btw flt was delayed 2hrs) and I dont take alcohol, couldnt offer me an extra cushion for my bad leg and back, because staff couldnt be bothered to look for one. As for myself, I don't drink, no xtra cushion, no choice of food during both meal times. So BA, what are passengers paying for? Please do not give excuses, BA, you can easily manage your meal supplies onboard. Passengers pay proper fare not to be treated like ' scrape bins' to be offered Leftovers. As a family have to think again if loyalty to British Airways is worth it? Possibly not!"

    "reviewDescription": "Scammers! Bumped from a flight Orlando to London, Delayed for over 6hrs with 2 kids. Applied for the statutory compensation we are entitled to which amounts to over 1k. BA have failed, and failed and failed to process our application. Excuses constantly made which i initially gullibly believed. Now 10 months later I realise it was all just a deliberate ploy to avoid paying. I am now going to have to issue a claim in the court. BA should hang their head in shame."

    "reviewDescription": "Poor customer service. I appreciate it is my problem but no help whatsoever from BA. Having bought 12 return tickets for a forthcoming holiday to Rome one member can't make it. Don't want to cancel the ticket, just substitute another passenger even if I have to pay an admin fee. BA insist I have to cancel it for a refund and buy a new one. Result, \u00a338 taxes only refunded meaning a loss of \u00a3450. For \u00a338 I would sooner take the loss and do a no show rather than give BA the opportunity to sell a ticket twice. On principle unlikely to use BA again."

    "reviewDescription": "Hideous experience with British Airways trying to order an online meal. First of all trying to do it online. I couldn\u2019t. Every time the screen said enter your Flight number it wouldn\u2019t allow me. No explanation.\nI phoned up using a number of press this press that options until I got a human. After taking my details and verifying them, he said he couldn\u2019t take payment over the phone and suggested that I do it in line. I gave up. What a pile of crap."

    "reviewDescription": "Consider the following experience and see if it is worth your time, money and sanity:\n1. Useless staff that refuse to help you in any ways and have the audacity to be rude to you (noticed this was prevalent mostly in staff of Indian/Pakistani origin)\n2. Don't know how to rebook a flight to save their own lives\n3. All you get for a cancelled flight was 10 pound gift vouchers to spend on refreshments on their ridiculously expensive stores (a win considered by broke and hungry people)\n4. Losing an entire day at a hotel because your flight was randomly cancelled.\n5. Having to contact the airlines from your country (in our case, Qatar Airways) to rebook a flight\n6. Going in the second day completely exhausted and only to have the rude staff chide you for having silly items like toothpaste/aerosols in your hand baggage\n7. Have rude staff make up fake issues about your boarding documents so that you don't get to board your flight. They will send you to different locations all around the airport over a silly issue that does not exist and will eat at the last bit of sanity you have left.\n\nDo I deserve to be disappointed? Yes. Honestly, as a tourist and a student, I expected so much more from the citizens of UK, who value punctuality and discipline quite highly. All I got from here is that they clearly don't value anything and anyone's time and any decency they show outside is merely an act. What an absolute shame."

    "reviewDescription": "Booked a holiday with flights for St Lucia. The holiday was fantastic!. And the BA sales staff were lovely!. Helpful and enthusiastic. Special thanks to \"Louise\" for fixing things. She was extremely professional and helpful. BUT and it's a big \"but\", there was a system/process error which resulted in ALL data for my wife and I including passport details being emailed to an unknown third party. BA reported the data breach internally, deleted the holiday and rebooked it. However, I will not use BA again. Data security is simply non existent. All one needs to completely bypass the normal ba.com login is the booking reference and surname to log in, make changes, view personal data, DOB, passport no, phone no's etc etc... absolutely shocking!. Thought I was seeing things. Also, in the last few days leading up to the holiday, we tried many ( dozens ) of time to contact BA but were told that BA was too busy and the call was ended. So I'd be very concerned about support should anything go wrong just prior to or during one's holiday. So, sorry BA. It's a 1 star review. BA staff wonderful. BA systems less so. I should add, that the actual flights and holiday were excellent in all respect. Such a pity about BA's system security and apparent lack of staff. There is no problem in getting through to sales, but I've never managed yet to get through to any other department. Will not use again."
