Three days before we are due to fly BA change carrier and offload us onto DAT.

In flight entertainment doesn\u2019t work, inflight meals are absolutely disgusting with no alternative options unless you state dietary requirements (I\u2019d sooner have had military ration packs - they\u2019re edible) and the grotty pillow given with that hideous cheap scratchy cover - just awful!\nFlew Heathrow - Dubai and back on BA (10-20 Sep) we were delayed in aircraft on the way out, entertainment broke within an hour of take off - we were advised an email would go to head office for our cabin section and we\u2019d all be comp\u2019ed as it\u2019s a known issue - I won\u2019t hold my breathe.\nOn the way back I was told there were absolutely no sweetners on the flight at all - twice, so I skipped it, we asked the other girl on the same trolley on the next drinks round and she handed me 2 sweetners from said trolley. Seems trivial but I just desperately wanted a cup of tea and have blood sugar issues and the first girl just couldn\u2019t be bothered to check her own trolley for some.\nAll passengers then got a text to advise our bags \u2018may not be on flight\u2019 ours were not - waited at the carousel for a hour until we had to give up and head home.\nTook an unbelievable amount of faff over BA app, website and external websites as well as a call to BA to log our lost baggage. How can you be getting your online service so wrong!?\nTook 48hrs for both of us to be reunited with our bags, it\u2019s just dire.. BA let us down in so many ways just a truly horrible experience."

    "reviewDescription": "Terrible experience with BA. Went to cairo that was a 4.5 hour flight and provided no food except a packet of crisp and a small bottle of water. No menu provided, hardly anything to buy to eat. When coming back from Cairo, we were forced to book all our hand luggage because there aircraft 'was full'. Aircraft also was late for take off both ways. AC was on in the aircraft but BA still cant afford to give blankets and we were freezing. I think easyjet and Ryanair can compete well BA. Atleast they are able to provide a menu for food you can buy and actually have decent food choices. BA can't afford that. Sorry but it's better for me to be honest."

Although there was a slight delay in taking off from Heathrow, I found both journeys to be unexpectedly enjoyable for a long haul flight.

I think people generally only leave reviews here if they are dissatisfied, hence the low scoring, but there are some very good experiences too."

    "reviewDescription": "I had a business class flight to Delhi from Manchester via Heathrow cancelled 10 hours before departure in July this year. After chasing my compensation for 5 months, I last week received my very first communication from customer services denying my claim. My flight was cancelled due to \u2018bad weather\u2019 (it was a glorious 21 deg, calm summer day) and so the cancellation was out of BA\u2019s control and compensation is not due. I did suggest the reason for cancellation I was provided with was a mistake, especially as a colleague travelling on the same flight has already received his compensation however this again was denied. BA have now closed my complaint as they stand behind the decision and there is no further dialogue necessary. I have been patient, courteous and calm so I can only conclude this is now BA\u2019s MO. Keep denying, openly communicate untruths, and eventually the customer will give up. I\u2019m embarrassed this organisation is our flag carrier. If you can use an alternative, even if more expensive, it\u2019s a much better choice."

The wifi service which you are required to use to purchased refreshments did not connect. When I requested assistance from the flight attendant, I was told to keep trying. After an hour of trying, they sold me a drink (by-passing) the system. On my return flight the same thing happened but I was told there was nothing they could do and I was left without a meal. There was also an argument between 2 passengers and the attendants where nowhere to be found. I pledged not to use BA year ago and this is a reminder why. I didn\u2019t want to use a budget airline because I wanted good service. Over priced and still after all these years, poor service. I will only use BA if there is no alternative."

    "reviewDescription": "I am completely shocked at how this is being handled. Our flight was cancelled 1 hour before take-off, with no explanation of why are what to do. As it was late in the evening everyone panicked and spread out to get a nearby hotel and grab their luggage. Our replacement flight given was for 6:30am the following morning and had gone from a direct flight home to now stopping over in Madrid. But I understand sometimes flight cancellations are completely out of control and we went along with the adventure. The replacement flight we were given when trying to check-in said \u201cCheck in status unknown - we could not get your e-ticket number so are unable to determine your check in/boarding pass status. Refresh the \u201cmy bookings\u201d sceen and try again.\u2019 We only had 3-4 hours sleep as we had to be at the airport for 4:30am, we had tried several times to check in through the app and were unsuccessful, we then went to the check-in desk and were met with VERY rude staff who told us there was nothing we could do and that we were not showing up as on the flight, and that we would have to ring BA to solve the issue. Bearing in mind it was 4:30am and the British Airways phoneline was not open until 9am. If you think this is a fair flight replacement, making us wait 5 hours in a foreign country waiting to speak to someone on the phone to then probably having to wait another 2 hours to be re-booked onto a flight, then British Airways customer service has completely lost all value and meaning.\n\nI do not accept the response from BA, making me go through my insurance. This was your fault, your system failed us and this needs to be looked over again. They keep saying we were offered a replacement flight, BUT WE DID NOT EXIST ON THE FLIGHT WHEN TRYING OT CHECK IN. So NO, you did not meet your own terms and conditions, we had no choice but to purchase our own flights just to get home after already dealing with a cancellation before.\n\nThe response of \u201cIf you decide to make other arrangements the contract of carriage between you and British Airways is terminated. This means we\u2019d no longer be responsible for the expenses you had as a result of your original flight being cancelled.\u201d This statement would be valid if our check-in had work and the replacement flight had been processed correctly, but in this case where your system and your staff left us in a position with no help, what on earth where we meant to do, I would have loved to have been given some guidance by your staff other than \u2018sorry you will have to ring BA we cant help you\u2019. I know for a fact this is a British Airways error, as there was other families with the same issue, one man had to repurchase the same flight, there was also a family of four that could not afford to repurchase 4 tickets so in result were left stranded for god knows how long. So I cant imagine you will be saying the same that there was \u201cnothing you could do.\u201d\n\nOnce we had eventually landed back in England, I spoke to a lady at the BA customer service desk and she agreed at the horrible situation we had dealt with and that we were completely entitled to a full refund. Why the hell would I purchase two flight tickets for the same bloody replacement flight, theres absolutley no benefit for me doing that. You did NOT uphold your promise in getting us home, so you will reimburse us.\n\nIt\u2019s now been over two months since the cancellation and the back in forth i\u2019ve had to deal with through your customer service is a joke. We were not looked after as customers after booking a BA holidays package, the panic and stress we felt at the airport when we told we did not exist as passengers on the replacement flight was unaccepatble.\n\nBe warned, if you think you are covered just because you\u2019ve booked a BA holidays, you are not. They do not care one tiny bit. I am now down \u00a31100, but I will continue to shout and fight my corner."

And seeing their rating at 1.3 on Trustpilot makes me understand that I am not the only unhappy customer.\nKnowing I would be able to fall asleep watching movies or TV shows on their in flight entertainment system was something I was looking forward to on this overnight flight. However, my console didn't work and instead I had a loud screaming toddler in the seat behind me that kept kicking my seat and some babies in Front. Only two hours into this already hell of a journey were we told that we should buy the WiFi pass for which we will get fully reimbursed.\nI followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs... What actual BS. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told my cabin crew I would be erfunden...the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor. What a waste of a flight and \u00a322. These are 14 hrs of my life I will never get back and forever remember. I will remember BA as the brand that once was that no longer is.

It has the most outdated IT system which is prone to booking and check-in errors, they have non existent customer service, poorly trained staff, luggage goes missing and flights are always delayed.\n\nWe flew BA recently to Naples from London for a honeymoon and will never fly BA ever again. We arrived for check-in 2hours 30min before the flight and queued for over an hour until there was only an hour left before boarding. Once we were prioritised at the check-in counter we then found out the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on the plane. A cascade of errors would then ensured we would miss the next standby flight 6 hours after our original flight. So we waited for another 3 hours to be put on a flight 9 hours after we were originally scheduled to fly. We had paid deposits for restaurants, taxi pickup, hotels in Amalfi coast which all had to be cancelled without refund. I submitted a claim for compensation given the delay, as is my right in the UK, but the case was closed as the system showed incorrect information: it showed the flight we ended up boarding rather than the original flight we were originally supposed to board. It showed a delay of 84min rather than showing the full picture of us being denied checkin, refused standby for the next flight and having waited over 9 hours at the airport. It seems BA is refusing to accept responsibility for their own error and is also refusing to compensate us. Absolute disgrace of a national airline. Never flying them ever again."

This resulted in me having to carry a 20kg+ case around to 4 different hotels, as well as trains and airports. I submitted a claim and they offloaded me to K2 Global who offered a poor substandard replacement. I accept that my case was not brand new, but I explained that my case was good for another 10 years, so why should I accept a non like for like case. Their response was to suggested I claim via my travel insurance! I directed my complaint back to BA and was met with a similar lack of ownership. I asked for the replacement case to have a non zip locking mechanism same as my previous case which would have cost them an additional \u00a316 - they refused! Again when I rejected this they directed me to my travel insurance to underwrite their incompetence and negligence. Their customer service team lack any grasp of the concept of customer service, do not read e-mails correctly and would rather antagonise a customer rather than take an easy solution of paying an extra \u00a316."

We duly arrived at the airport, checked in and went to the gate when flight was called. No plane on the apron! They made a few announcements that the plane had a technical problem then, an hour after the flight was due to leave, the flight was cancelled.\nUnder the current legislation BA have to get the passengers to their destination as soon as possible, even if it means using a rival airline. So, for the passengers who paid for their flights in currency they found them split flights using BA on the first leg into the USA and their Americal Airlines partner to fly them on to Nashville on Saturday 23rd September. However, if you paid by Avios they completely ignored the regulations and said we had to fly on the first available BA direct flight, which was on Sunday 24th September, a day after everyone else.\nClearly if you collect Avios then use them to pay for your flights you are a third class passenger, at the bottom of the pile.\nAdded to this my wife and I are both in our 70s yet BA decided to sit us on separate rows, one behind the other, on a nine hour flight. Totally unacceptable.\nI tried BA's so called customer services department to make sure we were sat together on the replacement flights. Surprise, surprise they don't deal with that, I have to call the executive club. I called on the number shown on the link they sent. THEY AREN'T TAKING CALLS!!!.

As a regular BA traveler, I have occasionally flown business class in the past, and I must express my surprise at the level of service we received despite paying a considerable amount extra for our upgrades.\n\nDespite multiple attempts to get the crew's attention for beverages, my requests were ignored. On an early morning flight, there was no offer of tea or coffee, and our meals came with jam and butter but no croissants. When I asked one of the flight attendants for one, she provided it without an apology for the initial omission. However, when I requested another for my friend, I was informed that none were left.\n\nThroughout the flight, my attempts to get the crew\u2019s attention were often met with them talking amongst themselves or engaging with other customers, seemingly avoiding eye contact even after pressing the blue attendant button.\n\nIf this is the standard service in business class, I may have to reconsider my choice of airline for future bookings. The duty-free service, in particular, felt rushed, and the attendant appeared uninterested in whether we placed an order or not.\n\nI hope my feedback helps in maintaining the high standards BA is known for considering we have several other flights booked, this experience is unacceptable and only seems to happen with Gatwick crew.\n\nThe lounge on the way back was disorganised, we got there at 2:20, the system was down owing to us waiting 15 minutes to get through.\n\nThere is a certain level of expectation when travelling business class, none of which has been met. In addition there was only 1 toilet in the lounge for women. You were once the UK\u2019s number one airline and from what I experienced I understand why it has been lost, how does BA maintain quality control?\n\nIn a time where we are experiencing a crisis not everyone has the affordability to fly business class.

Not heard anything at all and no way of communicating with them.\nThis is a company happy to take your money but, actually couldn\u2019t care less about its customers.\nAVOID \u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f.\nFly with an airline, who actually values its customers."

Apparently they also don\u2019t pick up the additional cost of airport parking, accommodation, car hire, dog kennels etc. we also need to be home for work commitments. We booked with BA because we mistakenly thought they would be reliable. Phoned the helpline over 10 times and it just states they are busy and try later. Appalling customer support and service."

    "reviewDescription": "I cancelled my booking due to unforeseen circumstances, this took months for someone to actually cancel it and at least about 20/25 phone calls as got told someone would call me but never did so had to chase again and again and explain the whole thing again then got told different reasons why it hadn\u2019t been cancelled, but then eventually just a few weeks ago someone from refunds called to process the fully amount of the flights and to an account that I gave details of and told this would be refunded in next few days, I then got a refund to an account that had closed and not the account I had given details of , and not only that but only for \u00a3239 of a \u00a31089 booking, I raised a complaint and they responded with only you only get part of your ticket refunded, I emailed back with an attachment of the email from British airways as proof of the full amount and account number that I was to be refunded to! This has been one of the worst and horrendous experiences of my life that should have been straight forward, even after all these months of getting this refund processed, with email of confirmation I am still having to deal with getting it sorted and getting my full refund to the correct account, no one has taken to consideration all these\nMonths of dealing with this and now once again having to deal with the refund and getting the money back, I actually cried when the email came back saying you got the refund, it was as though they did not read my email!! HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER CARE THAT ACTUALLY JUST TOCK BOXES AND SAY THEY WILL SORT AND ACTUALLY DO NOT DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!"
