    "reviewDescription": "A horrendous experience just had with these clowns. My flight was cancelled at 04:00 on the day of return for a 13:00 flight. They auto-allocated a flight for the the evening of the following day, no good to me. There was no support at the airport or via phone. They were useless. We had to pay for new flights, hotel for an unscheduled night, transfers, food, parking delay penalties and having to transfer from the wrong airport to go and pick up my car at the original airport.\n\nI cancelled the auto-rescheduled one and was sent an email with my refund of \u00a30. Brilliant. I now find that I have a new booking for exactly one month after the original return flight (Like I'm going to stay abroad a month to catch it!) and finally I discover I can't cancel it as the BA system is telling me it was created by an external agent, which it wasn't!\n\nHow long have you been doing this??"

    "reviewDescription": "I would like to give no stars if I could, as for the second time of flying with BA this year and paying \u00a375 each to pre book our seats, both times we were told the seats were unavailable and were moved to other seats, in April they couldn\u2019t give a reason why and after boarding we saw other people in our seats, the on board crew had no idea why we were changed and confirmed the people sitting in our seats had not paid for their seats, enquiring further we found out the lady and child in our seats had asked if they could be moved to a window seat!!!! After some time the cabin crew resolved it, but it was a horrible start to our 9 hour flight and our honeymoon! In October we again flew with BA and pre booked our seats thinking our first incounter was a one off, but apparently we were wrong, as at the gate we were told my seat was unavailable due to it being unable to recline\u2026\u2026 I was fuming and said I was still prepared to sit in it for our 10 hour flight but the gate crew were insistent that we couldn\u2019t have it, on boarding I explained to the crew we had been moved but I was happy to sit in a non reclining chair, the cabin crew were great and let us sit in our originally paid for seats, which proved that I was told a lie as my seat reclined perfectly!!! In April after many complaints I managed to get a \u00a3100 voucher to spend on another holiday, which we used in October, but had exactly the same fiasco, my complaint is still ongoing as BA\u2019s complaint system is a shambles, I don\u2019t expect to receive any good will jesture as it seems BA are out of goodwill and I won\u2019t be flying with them again anyway! It seems pre-booking seats with BA is just another money making scheme!"

Alas not possible because the BA site is not working (again)!\n\nBA is yet another organisation that has fallen into the trap of assuming FAQs and call centres will solve all their problems.\n\nFAQs generally list only the topics that organisations seem to think customers encounter - without giving any options for customers to describe topics that are not listed.\n\nI tried the BA 'helpline' number and followed the auto-messages to finally talk to someone. The first person tries to transfer me to another team that is 'supposed' to help - only for me to encounter another auto-message, at which point the call auto-terminates!\n\nThe second person advises that due to the high volume of calls to the 'helpline' my call has been diverted to her, who then tells me to try again later! No help at all really.\n\nMy answer to all this is that if any organisation is experiencing a high volume of calls to their helplines it means the services or products they are supposed to be offering are non-existant or faulty. Surely it is more cost effective to provide an efficient product and service than to spend millions on call centres who try - and fail - to provide some kind of resolution."

This would of been a disaster if I had not tried to check in online as would not of known it was cancelled.\n\nWe were booked on a later flight BA0607 departing Pisa at 20.20. We were travelling with two other members of our family who were unable to check in online. On arrival at the airport we were informed that they had been bumped off of the flight completely as the flight was overbooked by 30 people which was a disaster as we had travelled to London Heathrow in their car.\n\nWe arrived at Pisa Airport in good time to be then advised that BA0607 had been further delayed to 23.30 then again until 01.30am on 02 August. we all finally boarded the plane to then sit on a hot plane on the runway for an hour and a half and then be advised by the pilot that the flight was cancelled again due to British Airways losing the slot.\n\nHe the advised they were struggling to get ground crew to get us off the plane with our baggage as Pisa Airport had closed. Finally the ground crew that were assisting the Easy Jet flight cam and got us off.\n\nThe pilot advised that we would all need to try and find our own accommodation for the night as there was nobody from British Airways to help at all. This was totally unacceptable considering we had already been separated from our family and even a disabled passenger was left to sit outside the airport all night.\n\nWe had to also find our own transport to the hotel which was difficult to get a taxi when the airport was closed.\n\nThe next day we received a text from British Airways advising the flight would leave at 2 pm, but again was delayed to 4 pm.\n\nI firmly believe that BA did not do enough to get us home on the same day, which is extremely disappointing as there were other flights departing that day from Florence and also an Easy Jet flight out of Pisa which left half empty as our friends had to book themselves onto this flight.

    "reviewDescription": "I had a very disheartening experience flying with British Airways recently. Firstly, the staff at boarding were outright rude, lacking any sense of customer service or professionalism. This immediately set a negative tone for the flight.\n\nAdditionally, the airline\u2019s policy on restroom access significantly impacted my comfort and convenience during the flight. Passengers without a First Class ticket were not allowed to use the bathrooms at the front of the plane, causing unnecessary congestion and discomfort. This rule resulted in long queues of over 15 people waiting for the two toilets at the back of the plane. The corridor was constantly crowded, making it difficult for passengers to navigate to and from their seats.\n\nAt one point, due to the cramped conditions in the corridor, a fellow passenger was forced to stand extremely close to me, invading my personal space significantly as others attempted to squeeze by. This was not only uncomfortable but also completely unacceptable. Imagine having an overweight person standing next to you, that tries to squeeze his ass on your space, bringing his ass next to your face, while trying to make space for a fellow passenger to walk by him to move back to his seat.\n\nOverall, my flight experience with British Airways was far from satisfactory. The treatment and policies displayed a lack of respect and consideration for passengers. I hope the airline reevaluates its customer service approach and policies to improve the experience for all passengers in the future."

I was fully prepared to forfeit the initial economy ticket price but not the upgraded fare to business. I gave over 12 weeks notice but BA were unmoving, however did state, in January, that it was under investigation. Now it\u2019s 6 months on and still with no final response. Truly unacceptable, incompetent and totally without any service to the customer. Shame on you British Airways."

    "reviewDescription": "Had direct flights Edinburgh-Florence/ Florence-Edinburgh Sept 24- Oct 1st cancelled both ways! Outbound:- Unable to rebook online and failed 4 times to stay connected after 40 /30 minutes to Customer Services . No notification whatsoever until 20 minutes before boarding. Various reasons given (lack of staff, staff sickness, technical problems) but didn't believe any of them. We suspect they couldn't fill the plane. No food vouchers given at airport. No BA staff, but Menzies did help by booking us flights to London City, then we had to rebook from there(Amsterdam-Florence). All the responsibility was on us to sort out this mess. Arrived 9 hours later than expected.\nInbound- Again, cancelled, but informed by text 5 hours after flight due to leave! This time they rebooked 2 flights too many; impossible to confirm or reject any of them online, so tried Online Chat which actually was very good! Hotel overnight , taxi provided to airport and arrived home nearly 2 days later. KLM alternative flights were excellent.\nSo instead of direct flights we had ridiculous European diversions to London, Amsterdam and Paris. Overall a dreadful, highly stressful experience. Shockingly poor customer service. Amazed at how much BA has changed its operations and service in recent years. What a shame."

We travelled club/business food was dreadful , cleanliness was non existent , the plane was so old there were ashtrays in the WC and the wc itself had lost all its colour and was just a brown hole . Incredible ."

    "reviewDescription": "Just returned from a long haul to Perth Australia, second leg of the trip from Singapore to Heathrow was absolutely amazing! May have helped that the plane wasn\u2019t full so grabbed a row of three! Always had brilliant flights with BA, but this one was superb! The cabin crew and the guy who was our steward was amazing! They\u2019ve had lots of issues but I can\u2019t fault them on this long haul trip"
