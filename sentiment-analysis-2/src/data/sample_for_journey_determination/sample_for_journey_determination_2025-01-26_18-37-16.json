He then without listing to me changed my seats back to the middle of the aircraft, I said no don't do this if there are no other seats available I will stay where we are at least I am somewhat near the toilet, he did not listen and he lost our seats at the back of the aircraft leaving me in the middle of the aircraft. I then had to explain to him and his supervisor why I told him not to move us again in front of a crowd of people causing me great embarrassment\n\nI paid for these seat and have tried to get my money back but I keep getting we are getting high calls/ emails at the moment.\n\nI am a BA executive member but not for long."

I had arranged wheelchair assistance at Seville before the trip but was refused it when arriving at the airport \"you can walk - it's a small airport\" When appealing this I was told I could get a chair after security. After struggling through this I was told none was available. I eventually arrived at the gate in a cold, sick sweat and in tears. The pain was horrific. I couldn't go any further and so was shouted at by three members of staff for not being able to walk any further. I don't know how anyone could be so cruel. It was awful doing 'the walk of shame' onto the aircraft. I don't have long to live and this was my last holiday. I'm heartbroken and humiliated. British Airways response was totally inadequate...they offered me some vouchers which are useless as I can't go anywhere again. I wanted to know that no-one else would have to suffer like this again but they brushed me off. They don't care and are acting illegally not facilitating travel for disabled people. Steer clear."

However, when checking in, we were allocated rooms on different floors. This issue was rectified and given rooms on the same floor (still not ideal). We provided paperwork to Hilton to show resort fees were waived, but still had to pay $400 per room for mandatory security deposit (British Airways did not inform us of this!) we paid this and it was refunded, but we have been charged the resort fees after checking out, even though we used no facilities during the stay and being told we would not be charged these fees.

    "reviewDescription": "Awful airline that doesn't care about its customers at all. Started with their dated website not letting me check in and saying my covid documents couldn't be verified, even though they actually were. As a result, I couldn't check in online and had to do it at the airport, where I got an awful seat. My flight was one of many many delayed BA flights today. I was told it would leave 4 hours later by a staff member. As I knew I would miss my connection, I tried to rebook myself in Heathrow as advised by BA staff. First thing I discovered is that BA don't bother staffing their customer service desk on the B gates side of the terminal. Nice 10 minute walk for me to the other side of the terminal to queue up and try to rebook. Agent tried to contact the ticketing team but no answer even though he tried for 10 minutes. Either they were all at lunch or busy trying to sort out the 10000s of people their shoddy management has screwed over today. Was then told flight was actually leaving in half an hour and had to run all the way back. On the plane I was promised ground crew would meet us when getting off the plane and help sort out connections. There was nobody there. I had to go through immigration and then make my own way to the American Airlines ticketing desk, seeing as I'd booked through them. They could only rebook me on a flight leaving the next day, which is exactly what I didn't want and why I was trying to rebook while still in the UK. As the operating airline, it's actually BA's responsibility to look after me and they did absolutely nothing at all to help, even though it was their fault. I am now missing a wedding, which is the main reason I am in the US in the first place. Instead, I am stuck in a cheap hotel in a city I don't want to be in. You pay a premium price but you get low cost service with BA. Choose another airline if you're going to pay that much. Maybe you'll actually get decent service."

    "reviewDescription": "Our experience started on arrival at Gatwick airport. Firstly the ba check in gave us 2 seats so far apart that we may as well been separated. On arrival at Gatwick we were treated like cattle and it was almost a game show to complete a series of check in within a few minutes.As we boarded the plane the crew were rude and did not Give a toss. As the sour faced crew moved up the cabin they handed out breakfast. This existed of a bottle of water and a cheap cereal bar. There was no food on the flight and you had to pay \u00a33.29 for a cup of coffee. If passengers wanted to use the toilet that had to wait behind the sour faced attendant who refused to move. Passengers who were desperate for the toilet were angry that they were told to wait until the trolley was at the other end of the plane. This trip made Ryan air seem like luxury. Cattle were treated with dignity. Passengers were constantly told to put things under seats. The seats were cramped and everyone looked miserable. What has happened to this formerly fantastic airline."

After waiting a month, I have tried several times to contact by phone, only to be cut off after being told their lines are too busy. I tried emailing but a reply was sent addressed to my dead husband and not me, and I was told to phone! I used their on line form but have had no acknowledgement of this after 3 days. I am going round in circles and cannot cancel my husband's credit card as I was told the only way they will refund me will be to send the refund to the card it was originally used to pay for the flight.

At this time the phone lines are closed so I sent a message on Twitter and an email. After trying for 3 hours, I received an email to inform me that I ran out of time to make the payment, therefore the price I reserved the tickets is no longer available. The same tickets are now \u00a3170 more expensive.\nI phoned customer service 8 am and after waiting for 20 minutes to be transferred to anyone, a very unhappy and tired lady answered. I've worked in cs before and can empathise, so I tried to go about it nicely. However, I was told that there is nothing she can do and that it is MY fault that I didn't phone them before the lines closed. I AM SORRY THAT I EXPECTED A FLAG-CARRYING AIRLINE WOULD HAVE A FUNCTIONING WEBSITE. Clearly, I expected too much from BA. Even after I explained that I did nothing wrong and was trying to make a payment well before the deadline given by the company and clearly the problem was on their side (especially since there are other people online complaining about the same thing for months now!), she insisted it was my own fault and there as I didn't make the payment, I lost the price I wanted and my deposit.\nIt seems like British Airlines have decided they are above everyone and can continue charging huge prices while scamming people out of their money twice - taking a deposit for a service and then not providing the service and leaving the customer with no option but paying the increased price or going to another airline. This was the first and the last time I planned to use BA."

The ticket clearly shows that each of us is entitled to one hand luggage and checked in luggage (making it 3 hand luggages and checked in luggages in all). We however had just one checked in luggage to be shared by all of 3 of us just because I chose to travel light. I was shocked when Alaska airlines said we needed to pay $75(cad) for the luggage (just one despite being entitled to 3) despite agreeing with me that our ticket shows that we infact could have 3 without having to pay. By the way, Alaska was acting on behalf of BA because there is no where on my ticket where Alaska appears except the inscription \u201cBritish Airways operated by Horizon\u201d. All efforts to get them to let me go without paying failed with them asking that I reach out to you as you are already aware of this. I called BA so many times to advise on how to get me refunded as advised by Alaska but I ended up being passed around. A staff member by the name Navneet responded to me days after saying \u201c I would like to inform you that every airline has their own policy and the charges that we charge for excess baggage may differ from other airlines. As your flight AS2105 was operated by Alaska Airlines, their baggage allowance will apply on that particular route. Therefore, for any applicable refund, I'd request you to contact Alaska Airlines directly on their website\u201d. How does this make sense? Operated by Alaska airlines acting whose behalf?To say the least, be this is the most terrible experience I\u2019ve had travelling as I had to wait in line for a long while with 2 little kids having make explanations that I thought I would avoid by choosing to fly a so called reputable airline like BA.

Have recently took early retirement as lost a kidney, this return flight from Cyprus to Gatwick was probably the worst I\u2019ve ever had. Boarded late, finally started to taxi out to be told by the captain that we are returning as they have a sick member of staff!!!!!!! The medical staff came on board, we were left sitting in the heat with no offer of water. (Remember I\u2019ve only one kidney so not very good for me). Then because a passenger was getting irate we was allowed to go back into the departure lounge where after another hours we were told the flight was cancelled, this is probably about 23:30 ish by now. We were taken to a hotel in paphos, no food or drink still and about 00:30 by now. Was not told what time to be ready for pick up so awoke early so not to miss the coach and flight. Finally took off around 13:30 ish. I put in a claim for drinks, sandwiches and for being delayed. It took them months to finally reject my claim and also said my recipe for food and drinks was not clear lol. Will never fly with British airways again. Ps I gave it one star as can\u2019t leave less."

The .gov.uk website asks people who are travelling between England and Dublin to check with their airline for what suitable photographic ID is.\n\nOnline they were twice hopeless. One told me what I wanted to hear, when I reconnected as I had little faith, I was told something different. When I called, the Advisor didn't have a clue and attempted to give me Manchester's checkin telephone number but then got cut off. I subsequently called again, waited in another long queue and again, as soon as the Advisor attempted to put me on hold, the call was cut.\n\nI have tried Tweeting- no response. I have tried calling a number for Manchester British Airways and it just rung out and disconnected me.\n\nIs this what you think of passengers full stop and what about those of us with disabilities who are first time flyers and need someone competent to give us initial advice to get things right? You'll be quick enough to refuse to compensate us if things go wrong and yet there is nobody competent enough to ask!\n\n1. Will the UK citizencard be suitable for travel from Manchester Airport to Dublin and vice versa?\n\n2. Will be it OK on flights operated by Aer Lingus on behalf of British Airways?\n\n3. How long should I leave after arriving in Dublin before my connecting coach - worst case scenario?\n\n3. Will my Manchester City Council personal alcohol photographic license suffice? My driving license photo is quite old.\n\nNeither of us have passports.\n\nPlease would you kindly do some internal calls posing as customers to your lines to get a flavour of how serious this issue is. Your website does not answer these questions- essentially, what photographic ID is deemed acceptable and the UK government clearly expect you to be able to answer these questions.

Once we got to Gatwick we were circling around the airport for about 10/15minutes before being told that we were circling and waiting for the storm to pass below us.\nWe were given complimentary pretzel things and water which was nice and not sure if this is on every flight or because we were delayed however this is the first time i have used british airways and disappointed mostly due to the staff.\nThe date was 4th September 22 or 5th as it was early morning we actually landed."

I have had several bad experiences with them in the past 5 years but I thought it might be exceptions, but my most recent experience has put me over the edge to boycott them.\n\nMost recently, I was denied boarding for my outbound flight, under the claim that I needed a visa for my transit location. I showed evidence that I didn't need any visa as I was transiting within 24h (I had also confirmed this with the embassy of the country in question), but BA said that it was under their discretion to decide. So I was denied my outbound flight and I had to buy a new ticket (obviously with another airline) to get to where I needed a few hours later.\n\nI speak with customer service who say they will split my booking so that I can keep my return flight, but then I don't hear back for weeks. When I call to follow up, close to my return date, and finally get through their long queues, I am told they will have to charge a fee for the change. I am put on hold while they figure out what the charge will be, and after 40 min on hold the call disconnects. I end up having close to a dozen calls with the BA customer service team (call centre in India without any real authority to support you) over the next days with contradicting information that I won't cover here.\n\nEventually, BA says that they won't be able to change the flight, and as a consequence my return flight is now invalid. The best they can do is issue a refund of some taxes of \u00a3380 out of the \u00a31400 we had paid. So I lost over \u00a31,000 without getting a single flight from BA!\n\nJust shameful."

For Business Class. The queues for Economy weaved round the departures hall but amongst the sea of whirling screens and closed lanes, it still took 20 minutes and some kettling for those who had paid serious money or were foolish, captive regulars to get to baggage check. The man at baggage check smiled when i suggested this was sub optimal and thanked me for my joke. The bags were checked and new boarding passes issued. I had been moved seats, closer to the front. As we headed to Fortnums to spend some money, i asked my wife whether her seat had changed too. It hadn't. I checked my new boarding pass again. It was for a different name and a different destination. Bizarrely it had worked at security as did my wife who, it turned out, was using my boarding pass. It crossed my mind that i and or my bag might not be able to get to Brindisi and so i sought assistance. I finally tracked down a \"Customer Experience Lead\" who, to be fair, worked hard to move the bag to the correct flight and reissued new boarding passes for me and my wife. Armed with these new boarding passes in correct names, we both passed through the automated boarding gates. I had thought that we were being tracked through the airport for, amongst other things, security purposes. But now i am not sure. Both our documented identities had changed twice from correct to wrong to correct on this passage through Heathrow but at no point had these changes impeded our progress.

    "reviewDescription": "Horrendous, last minute flight cancellation last June by BA Heathrow at 22.00 to catch Venice cruise after delaying us for 4 hrs earlier, no hotels available at that time of night ,no help desk assistance, so spent night on T5 bench , then given a hotel in gatwick for 2nd holiday night to catch flight out on day 3 to embark on cruise ship late.\nMissed 2 days of holiday for a lovely night on a bench and a stunning night in gatwick.\nBA then claimed flight cancelled due to bad weather so don`t owe us any compensation and only prepared to pay incurred expenses for food.\nJust received notice they have now even closed that claim without paying a bean of my meagre \u00a375 food for 2 days bill.\nSimply awful customer service , my wife and i have been BA Flying Club members for years but honestly, never again, hope the shareholders enjoy my costs money in their profits"

    "reviewDescription": "We flew premium economy to NYC on the 10th of May. And what a pleasant experience that was. The plane was clean, fresh and modern, the air smelled clean, so first impressions were good. Then we were served snacks and a drink by a cheerful flight attendant. When I pointed out that there was milk in the snacks, she went and got me a bag of mixed nuts from the business class section. Then the meal came. I had pre-ordered a vegan meal for myself, my husband had a curry. The food was fantastic, everything was tasty and fresh. They even had soy milk for hot drinks. We want to thank BA and give Caroline a massive thank you as she went above and beyond to ensure the flight was a pleasant experience.\n\nWord of advice to BA, it might be time to find a better flight partner than AA as our return trip was below par."

    "reviewDescription": "British Airways are really bad in every terms ,customer services is the worst\n\nI was on phone with them for at least 1 hour to make sure i didn\u2019t get no-show,so that i can at least claim for additional baggage refund,since i was not going to board the flight due to illness. After all assurance that i won\u2019t be marked as no-show,when i tried to claim the baggage refund later,i was told that i have been marked as No-show,how unprofessional and cheating is this of BA\n\nI was avoiding to is BA due to their bad reputation,but fall for low price,but in future 200% i am not flying with BA"
