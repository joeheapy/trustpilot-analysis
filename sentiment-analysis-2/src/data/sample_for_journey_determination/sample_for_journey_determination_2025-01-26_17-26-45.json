    "reviewDescription": "Our flight was delayed due to the Air Traffic control issue that affected most airports and airlines in Summer 2023. That is not the reason for the low score as that was not within BA's control. What was within their control is their updates to customers. We were told to come to the airport on the usual flight time despite it showing as delayed by two hours as it may still depart on time unless we receive an email stating otherwise. I got that email at 9.31am, our flight was scheduled for 9.35am. So we arrived hours early to sit around (with young kids) and eventually the flight departed at ~12.30pm.\n\nA second issue was with the flight attendants. The plane was half empty with rows with just one passenger. There was one row completely empty so we asked if we could move one of the kids there to go to sleep but were told the row was broken, then blocked. When I queried why, I was given the most ridiculous excuse that since the plane was not full it was unbalanced and the row needed to remain empty to prevent the plane falling out the sky. Ten minutes later 3 flight attendants sit in the row and go to sleep!"

Last year, my husband and I excited to join the post-pandemic travel chaos while Heathrow cancelled tons of flights and queues at the airports were massive everywhere. Our trip was not far, only to Milan. They keep sending us flight was on schedule until last minute the flight was cancelled. Knowing not everyone lives in London, they redirected us to Gatwick next day, which not gangrenated would take off either. Not a single customer person to deal with the issue. By this point we paid car parking and it was not refundable once we in. Too much to loose if next day flight not going to take off so we cancelled the flight and drove home. There were many flights were not cancelled but I guess our flight was just not full enough so they chose us to cancel? It was very stressful to deal with hotel, tourist attraction ticketing cancellations. After all, we have been contacted BA filled the foams, waited several months before they got back to us. Answer was : ''not under their control. ''emmm...so not met their compensation claim''. So many months later, we still out of pocket and it was worst experience with them ever. ... BA can say pandemic caused everything, but there were many countries did much better job than us during that time. For example Italy. Ask if I'd still travel with them? I would avoid as much as possible, no more long hauls, other short trips, I would find alternatives where possible. I am sure they would not care for an individual like me."

No function on the app allowed us to alter this. So we had to phone, and phone, and phone.....\nWhen we finally got through the BA rep implied they had no sympathy that my wife had accidentally changed both flights and thus we were no longer entitled to a refund under their 'fair use' terms. Their laughable title, not mine.\nWe asked to speak to a manager - she refused. She did finally talk about vouchers and e-vouchers and explained the benefit of an e-voucher was it would be possible for my wife to use it within the next year, the other type of voucher only I could use (despite the fact that my wife paid for the flights). So we asked her to go ahead with the e-voucher. She then told us that we now had a useless voucher - not the e-voucher - the system had decided this and she had never promised an e-voucher anyway.\nVoucher is no use at all - I will never fly with BA and I can't image my wife will too. Smug 'Gotcha' Ts and Cs from the 1980s with no idea of customer service - so disgusted with them - really feel for the staff who have to deal with customers face to face rather than shielded by a phone line.\nI will never ever use BA and will not hold back in advising others not to either."

She told us to leave it with her and she would ensure our luggage would go onto the correct flight.\n1.5 hours before boarding the new flight, we thought we would double check with someone else that our luggage had been transferred correctly, to which he told us no, our luggage was still on the first delayed plane!! He told us to leave it with him and he would ensure we got our luggage.\nNeedless to say, that when we arrived in Heathrow our luggage was not there. We were told by the lady at the lost baggage that we would likely receive it back in 72 hours.\nThe next day, we received an email to tell us that our luggage was making its way to Heathrow. Then, for the next two days we heard nothing. When phoning BA they confirmed that our luggage was definitely with Heathrow and that we would receive an email the next day to tell us it was on our way to our home. This never happened, and BA continued to give us the same response every single day for an entire week. Getting frustrated, we phoned the airport we were travelling from who told us that THEY had our luggage and that it wasn't at Heathrow!! The next day we got another email to tell us the baggage was being sent from that airport to Heathrow, and BA continued to tell us we would then receive our luggage 48 hours later. We have never received our luggage, and BA are continuing to tell us that Heathrow definitely have it. If Heathrow have our luggage, THEN SEND IT TO US! We have literally been waiting WEEKS for our luggage that they apparently have.\nBA's customer services are absolutely diabolical.

We booked our holiday 6 months in advance and ba cancelled 14 days and a couple of hours prior to departure, just in time for them to avoid compensation claims. They don't try to help just explain that you will have to claim a refund or another flight. If you try to call they have a message that claims they are busy and asks you to call later, it never works. The only way through is to choose an option that makes it look like you will spend money with them. If you try to complain about their service to them they have a very clever method of preventing you, you choose the 'cancelled flight' option then it asks you the details of the flight but because the flight is cancelled it doesn't recognise it so you can progress any further. We tried to cancel our car booking but it will not process it on their website, just says 'try again later'. BA does not care about their customers they have designed there whole service around not loosing money and have lost any empathy for their customers.

In all my years of flying with cheap and cheerful airlines, the irony is that when I happened to book flights as part of my package deal through BA, I made the mistake of thinking I would get a superior service. How wrong I was. This company is a complete con and if you need to change the name on your booking (to a different person), they force you to buy BRAND NEW TICKETS. First of all they tried to blame the travel agent, but no, let's be clear: the travel agent was more than happy to make the change. It is BA's policy not to allow name (person) changes. I have never had a problem in the past on the occasion that I've needed to change passenger details. BA seems to be the only airline that doesn't offer this extremely basic, simple service. It is so basic and frequently requested in fact that I'd go as far as to say it's one of the only functions a passenger needs to contact customer service about at all - so why bother offering a 'customer service' line if you have no policies in place to support the customer? Truly shocking. BA quite sinisterly term the simple procedure of changing the name on a flight as 'body swapping' and speak of it in hushed tones as if it is the most unspeakable request imaginable.

My experience has mainly been of clean planes, bright interiors, helpful crews and a general less cattle class experience than low cost airlines. In past three years Ive had a number of flights cancelled or rescheduled due to covid and capacity issues at Gatwick. Unlike many on Trustpilot BA have always assisted in accommodating changes, vouchers etc (once actually get through on the phone). In my experience I'd give the,punctuality, plane crew and ground staff 4-5 every time!\n\nHowever, I'd give one based on my customer experience since April where I've been trying to get a full refund or voucher due to my having to cancel a flight on 19th April. Which BA customer care agent(s) erroneously claim couldnt be cancelled due to one of the two passengers having already 'checked in'. The two passengers being me and my 10 year old son who was waiting for his passport to arrive which didn't arrive in time hence we couldn't fly. BA have been totally disintrested never asking for any information including screen shots from when I tried to cancel in good time. Despite this apparent data breach dealing with BA for valid refund has been a nightmare. I've probably had to exchange over 25 emails with BA complaints department who ignore the specifics of my complaint and copy and paste standard text or clich\u00e9s responses each time after I wait weeks between replies. BA cant confirm who or when one of us checked-in, despite the security issues relating to a seeming imposter passenger. Im now waiting BA 'deadlock' letter before the further agro of independent escalation/small claims for what is a modest sum of a voucher that ironically will be used on same airline anyway! So frustrating as if BA complaints and/or customers services (assume role is to resolve issues) where to actually look at my experience they'd see the fairness of processing a full refund/voucher without further delay."

We upgraded on the way to Vegas and they were so good to deal with.\nOne star down because you cannot get hold of the right people to speak to on the phone if you book a BA holiday - it's an hour of your life you don't get back, and often they can't help. Wish you could manage your holiday better online -then I would travel more."

The flight should be leaving in twenty minutes and we still have not received an email or text or anything to say the flight is cancelled, and when you call the number we were given at Newcastle airport, you get a message saying \u2018we are not answering phones, contact us online\u2019 I will never use this company again!

    "reviewDescription": "Please read this, Me and my Mrs had only 10 flights in 2024 all business class and all European holiday flights, only one went on time, every excuse possible not to fly, a bird strike, a scratch on the wing, air con faulty, pilot overtime, lost slot, fog, cloudy, to windy, no one to operate the jetty, move to another airport by bus, it goes on and on and on and on, they change my fully paid for club class sets without any notification. Also 2 flights they couldn\u2019t serve any nuts because of some nut idiot on board had preferential treatment over the remaining 150 passengers, when did this woke nut lot suddenly invent this, BA said it\u2019s a fatal allergy lol, next time I\u2019m taking a snickers on board, please watch Ricky Gervais nut allergy hilarious and it\u2019s very true, the last 2024 flight which was yesterday was delayed and we sat for over 3 hours on runway for a 1.15 hour flight and then they said the food could poison us due to the delay so didn\u2019t serve any, it was a salad lol again, they are so woke so pathetic it\u2019s beyond a joke, the club class check in T5 is a disjointed mess out of control queue which is now much longer than euro travellers, the club bags always come off last, if you tell of your disappointment the staff look at you with horror as if you are a right wing racist, it\u2019s bonkers, shocking clueless management from the top down, who are these people! The worlds most hated airline, we added it up, we actually spent more time on the runway in 2024 with delays than actual flying, just got back from Geneva spent 3 hours sitting on the runway 2 passengers in club after 2 hours said at least give us a drink, BA crew said we can\u2019t it\u2019s against policy, the 2 lady passengers then were very angry and rightfully so missing a connection flight, in the end BA served some drinks reluctantly. When I boarded this last 2024 flight the attendant said how\u2019s your day going, I said it was ok until I got on this plane, the look of horror her woke jaw hit the carpet, I was right as we sat on the runway as stated for over 3 hours. According to some friends this just doesn\u2019t happen with Ryan air or Easy jet they just go and we watch then out the BA window, It\u2019s a bus nothing more nothing less. BA have taken over so many routes they now need to loose some or all of them. Is it hate speech because I hate them? I\u2019ve got to find an alternative solution for 2025, I promise anyone who reads this there is no exaggeration, it\u2019s worse than I can explain in this review, enjoy your vacation or business trip hopefully without this lot. I\u2019ve never claimed compensation as I simply don\u2019t have the time to fill it all in as they deliberately make it very difficult to talk or claim. I don\u2019t expect a reply. Ohh I forgot they also lost out luggage on a flight."

Their app doesn't work, you can only check in on-line 24 hours before departure (stressful if you're on holiday trying to sort your return flight), and they forced about 20 passengers to put their tiny carry-ons in the hold, even though plenty of overhead bins later proved to be only half-full (I could actually see them).

    "reviewDescription": "I always used to enjoy flying BA but the service has massively diminished in the past few years. I was due to fly to Marrakech on the 25th March, there was a fault with the plane so a replacement was found with too few seats, fair enough you don't want to fly on a faulty plane but the communication to customers was terrible and we only found out after a 3 hour wait when trying to board the plane we were not allowed on and there was no plan for when we would make it to Morocco, it then took a further 3 hours to get our luggage back and exit the airport with no idea of what replacement flight options were on offer, no one to talk to with any useful information. I was then put on a flight two days later which had a stop over, as I was supposed to be joining a touring bike trip this was too late, no one at the airport could help me find another more suitable flight, nor on the telephone line after waiting in a queue for 1.5 hours. When finally managing to speak to someone on the phone I asked them to refund my flights and cancel the return as I had missed the tour. After waiting 10 days I phoned to chase my refund for flights and was told this had been rejected, as my cancellation hadn't been logged correctly. I now have to wait a further 10 working days to see if I can get a refund. Other people who made the flight from my group have been paid compensation for the delayed flight, I have not have my claim for compensation responded to for missing the holiday nor is there anyone I can talk to at BA, the call operator I had was not able to help me, after spending another 1.5 hours on the phone. It's really frustrating that you cant speak to anyone at BA who can have a sensible conversation about the poor experience I've had on my missed holiday due to the flight cancellation. It feels like BA don't care about reputation and protecting future business from customers."

    "reviewDescription": "I was going to write to BA but I really don't think they care enough.\nHere is our experience of LHR/YVR/LHR:\n\nCheck in. Told that the first class check in area was busy and to use the regular check in.\nFirst class lounge outbound: Luke warm soup, luke warm salad.\nOutbound flight: Fantastic. But, our baggage was offloaded after about a hundred other bags. We expected some sort of priority.\nFirst class lounge inbound: Terrible. Dirty seats / area. Self service and a tip jar on the counter.\nInbound flight: Brilliant.\nHowever, we have only just received our bags. 3 days after we landed.\nI'm sure that blaming the airport will feature in BA's reasons for offering such a poor service. I may be wrong but isn't BAs handling done by BA?\nNo public announcements were made until we personally asked the customer services representative. We were then told a series of ever changing excuses as to why our bags hadn't come off the aircraft until, after a 3 hour wait, my wife had had enough and requested them to be delivered.\n\nBefore you start to think we are rich people who can't be pleased. Don't. This was our honeymoon trip which was booked over two years previously.\n\nCovid intervened, which was not BAs fault, but during this time BA attempted to downgrade us on more than one occasion. We spent in excess of 5 hours on the phone to various areas of BA, arguing the right to keep the seats (class of ticket) that we bought in the first place.\nBA should be rightfully ashamed of giving this quality of service to any passenger. To offer this service to a first class passenger is an absolute disgrace.\nIf BA read this please be assured I will not be palmed off with a free T shirt or the 'threat!' of a discounted ticket. I do not want either. I just want any possible travellers to be made aware of the (lack of) service on offer by BA.\nIn future, I will not be travelling, if the only people to offer a flight are BA. It is as simple as that. I am voting with my feet. In the interim I will be using some of my retired time searching out social media review platforms to ensure that other flyers are made aware of what to expect for your hard earned money where BA are concerned."

The staff are also older and more dishelved and not as smart than my experiances on other airlines.\nI thought the food was very poor and extremley small portions, seat space was considerably small for a long hall flight. We were not given enough snacks and the there was only one new release film available on the selection.\ni think when you are flying a long hall flight and dont get a warm towel it says a lot about the airline. It is also the first time in decades i have ever been delayed and usually travel much longer flights than this one.\nThis was not a cheap flight and we had to pay extra to get theseats we wanted which for infomation was only and end of an isle.\nI think my experiances with long hall flights with otrher airlines are much better and will continue to fly with them going forward.\n"

    "reviewDescription": "After a 14 hour flight from Hong Kong to London Heathrow, I received a message saying that my connecting flight to Glasgow was cancelled due to operational reasons. I was met at the airport by a BA representative who handed me a boarding pass and told me that I was rebooked on a flight at London City Airport. She was more interested in finding other passengers on her list than answering questions about how to do this.\nThere is no shuttle bus between the airports. I had to collect my luggage, travel across London on the Elizabeth line and then wait hours before I could check in at London City Airport. It would have been helpful if I was told that baggage from cancelled flights are placed at carousel 11 instead of the carousel for the flight I arrived on. I wasted an hour due to this. I wasn't told that I needed to take the Heathrow Express to Heathrow Central, change to the train for Abbey Wood, get off at Woolwich, trek to the Woolwich Arsenal DLR station and take the DLR to London City Airport. With heavy luggage. I wasn't told that my voucher for food was only valid at Heathrow. I had to pay for the transport myself, there is no reimbursement if I accept the rebooking.\nHere is the worse part of this, my cousin was also supposed to be travelling on the cancelled flight. She arrived later and wasn't met on arrival so she went to their desk and was rebooked on a flight from Heathrow later in the day. I wasn't even told I had a choice. The lack of information or support is staggering. After this experience I won't be travelling with BA unless I have no choice whatsoever."

BA stated thay they would pay the compensation(\u00a3520) per person) within 21 days of the email confirming the agreed amount. Despite at least three more phone calls chasing this we are now about 6 weeks over the stated period. BA even asked to re clarify payment details which was in the original claim form.

I can\u2019t understand how this sort of thing happens when I checked my bag In at the same time as my partner. I have special items and medication In that luggage that I need asap. Items that are in the bag are irreplaceable and the fact no one can give me an update as to where my belongings are is disgusting. After reading the reviews I can see that lost luggage is a regular occurrence with BA and I can guarantee I will never been using their service again. I might have considered staying a customer if their communication and updates would have be sufficient but making me wait with no update for this amount of time is awful."

    "reviewDescription": "They keep getting worse and worse.\n\nWhere to begin ...\n\nUnhelpful and rude customer service?\nConsistent flight delays (5 hours in one of my flights quite recently)?\nLoss of luggage and no assistance in the aftermath?\nGhosting you after saying they will get back to you with compensation for a delayed flight?\nContinuing to ghost you after you reach out to follow up on their lack of action?\nStupidly extortionate up-marking of flight prices when you book it as an amendment instead of a new booking - just so they can pocket more money? (This happened to me just yesterday)\n\nThis has been my experience across multiple BA journeys over the past few months. On a level of principle, I'm never booking with BA again, even if other airlines are offering more expensive rates."

    "reviewDescription": "Booked a business class flight to Europe, both legs cancelled resulting in missed meetings at both ends of the trip (that could not be rebooked at short notice, outbound flight cancelled with 6 hours notice) and hence business opportunity loss. Outbound cancellation resulting in being downgraded to economy on rebooked flight with no mention of compensation. More the wording suggesting I am accepting economy for business class cost.\n\nThe fast track at Heathrow terminal 5 is never faster than the normal security gates (the security staff also happily admit this), I would even say now that bag drop is quicker at the other gates than the club world so best avoid this too.\n\nEven with Silver status, the phone lines just say phone back later and I am still waiting to hear back through twitter. Considering when I last contacted them through their twitter channel to give them positive feedback it took them 2 days to respond. I am not holding out much hope of a response. The reason I have time to write this feedback, my flight is once again delayed. Making it, I want to say 5 delayed flights in a row, but let's be generous 5 in the last 7. Not reliable enough for business flights."

    "reviewDescription": "I can't say how bad the process within customer service is in BA. They have over charged me because of a change and blamed me for using the online web tool instead of calling them. And now because I seen the charges on my credit statement it's too late to give me a refund. Honestly BA is becoming the worst airline to fly with, no common sense approach being used to enhance the experience, none what so ever."

    "reviewDescription": "wow here i am again with yet more great experiences from BA.\nMy father in law died whilst myself and my husband were on a trip to Montreal. We had to rush back, so changed our flights to 48hrs earlier than the original tickets. We had a fair bit of being sent backwards and forwards between them and expedia, but eventually paid 2.5k to change our flights.\nWe saw that we then couldnt check in, which was worrisome. So we decided to go to the airport early-the queues were massive. We eventually got greeted by someone who couldnt find our reservation, and coldly told us we have to pay again. When we explained the urgency of the situation, we then learnt that BA could actually see the pending payment from expedia. When challenged on why we had to pay again if this is just a partnership issue between BA and expedia, they acted disgracefully and almost callously. Gone are the days where theyd be compassionate\u2026 either cough up for a problem that isnt ours, or go back to montreal. They couldnt care less.\nunder duress, we ended up paying twice just to get back home. And now, on top of all the funeral and death stuff, we have to act as accounts people to get our money back.\n\nto add insult to injury, we then were sat next to an off duty BA employee who was bragging about the flight being free and getting business class perks in premium economy. Glad BA treats employees well, wish you treated paying customers even 25% like that so we can at least get a dignified service.\n\ni hope BA, and the IAG, collapse."

I paid for him to be upgraded to World Traveller Plus. When he boarded the plane his assigned seat was broken and he was asked to leave the plane while they tried to repair the seat.\nAfter everyone was boarded on the plane they allowed him to board again and told him as they could not fix his seat he had to sit in economy.\u00a0 He was put him at the very back of the plane and are refusing to give his money back. BA are taking advantage of his disability as he cannot prove they moved him. Disgraceful treatment of a vulnerable person."

    "reviewDescription": "I have never experienced anything worse when it comes to airlines unfortunately. I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for \u00a3250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back and that the phone call is recorded. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money.\nI never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or just the actual cost of the flight.\nI was first transferred 3\u20ac (!!) by British Airways and told that they can't listen to the recording. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was \"weather conditions\" although all other non-BA flights were going... I lost over \u00a3700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people.\nWorst service/airline ever."

Even though we purchased a seat with more legroom, these ladies were not able to book into the assigned seats. At the end they said: \u201cyou have to decide if you are going to travel in this seat that we put you in or not, we will not do anything for you\u201d. We'll see how she gets to her final destination. Very disrespectfully"

    "reviewDescription": "Aside from the constant last minute flight cancellations, the reason I now go out of my way to avoid flying with BA is the officious, arrogant, cheap, unpleasant attitude some of their staff display. Things go wrong, it happens, but when you come away feeling not just let down but insulted, you have to ask the question\u2026 why would I carry on giving you my money? Well I for one no longer do, and my recommendation to others is to pay more if necessary to fly with other carriers. The BA brand used to promise a certain level of experience, but their cost-cutting exercises over the years have left the short-haul services far too similar to the low-cost airlines with their very many additional add-on costs and paper-thin service. I can get that experience with easyJet or Ryan Air, so why would I fly BA!? Madness. Their whole operation just leaves you feeling cheap, and that\u2019s assuming you\u2019re lucky enough to actually reach your destination with all their IT problems, staffing issues, and cancellations. I\u2019ve flown with BA a lot over the decades, but no more. Do yourself a favour and fly with someone else, a carrier that actually make you feel like a valued customer, because these guys don\u2019t."

What\u2019s a little 12 kg of squirming joy to hold for an eternity, right? And who doesn\u2019t love the fun of no toilet breaks for 12 whole hours?

I just can\u2019t wait to write to the ombudsman and see if the UK truly has a consumer protection system.\n\nOh, what a memorable experience!

So today (18/01/2024), we had to cancel our BA flights in April 2024 from Barcelona back to the UK. Paid \u20ac473:96 for the flights. Called BA and they informed me they were nonrefundable flights, but I could get a refund for the tax paid. Tax paid: \u20ac62:96, less the cancellation fee of \u20ac60:00 !!!\nWhat a company, you have another 3 months to sell these seats again, which you probably will.

    "reviewDescription": "Disappointed with Discomfort: A Review of British Airways Shorthaul Business Class and VIP Lounge\n\nMy recent British Airways experience left me feeling more like a harried babysitter than a relaxed business traveler. Let's break it down:\n\nShorthaul Business Class: Cramped and Underwhelming\n\nBA's shorthaul business class is a masterclass in disappointment. Sure, the blocked middle seat offers a theoretical increase in space, but in reality, the seat pitch feels identical to economy. Forget about stretching out or even getting comfortable enough for a decent nap. It felt more like a high-priced game of airplane kneesies.\n\nFood and Drinks? Meh. The complimentary food was, well, complimentary. Edible, but nothing to write home about. The free drinks were a minor perk, but again, not exactly a deal-breaker on a short flight.\n\nPriority Boarding: A Glimmer in the Gloom? The only saving grace was priority boarding, which saved a few minutes of queueing hell. However, this meager advantage couldn't erase the overall feeling of being trapped in a glorified economy class with a slightly shinier seat.\n\nPrice vs. Experience: A Mismatch\nThe price premium for shorthaul business class felt like a cruel joke. For that price, I expected significantly more. This felt more like a budget airline experience with a business class label slapped on.\n\nBA VIP Lounge: A Lawless Cr\u00e8che Disguised as Relaxation\n\nNow, let's talk about the BA VIP lounge. It was supposed to be a sanctuary from the pre-flight chaos. Instead, it resembled a lawless cr\u00e8che gone wild. Screaming children ran amok while their parents, seemingly oblivious (or intoxicated by the \"free\" everything), sat back and reveled in the complimentary food and drinks. There was no escaping the cacophony, making relaxation an impossible dream.\n\nOverall: Avoid BA shorthaul business class and the VIP lounge if even a hint of legroom or peace is important to you. You're better off saving your money and flying economy, or consider a different airline that offers a genuine business class experience with comfortable seating and adult-oriented relaxation areas.\n\n"

This meant i had to make my own way from one to the other and occured over a 100gbp taxi fair and trains and tubes with all the changes with luggage is unrealistic.\nI filed my complaint, its been a month and a half and i've heard nothing.
