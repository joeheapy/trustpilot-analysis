    "reviewDescription": "My company booked flights via BA for a flight operated by Aer Lingus for several of our staff. These were the only flights we could get from this location (Cork > Heathrow).\n\nUnfortunately on the day, Aer Lingus cancelled the outbound flight and sent us emails confirming this. Our staff had to leave the airport and could not travel. We were told by Aer Lingus that we had to go back to the point of purchase to get a refund.\n\nOn approaching BA we were told that their system had not updated so the flight appeared to have gone ahead and as such we were considered 'no shows', even though we had written proof in several emails which we provided from Aer Lingus to say that the flight was suspended due to unavoidable operational issues and that we had been told we could change flights or get a refund. As such, BA's information regarding this flight was not up to date and was incorrect.\n\nI was told by the member of staff at BA 'customer service' that **I** had to contact Aer Lingus to get a written email confirming that the flight was cancelled despite providing proof in several emails from Aer Lingus already.\n\nI as a customer of British Airways should not have to do all the legwork because BA's systems had not updated. Why did this staff member not call Aer Lingus herself for a confirmation for me? Why was I left to organise further proof for the refund myself? Why are they selling flights with 3rd Parties if they aren't able to keep track of each flight they are selling?\n\nWhen I got a response from Aer Lingus by email confirming that I was due a refund, this was not accepted by British Airways. I have *AGAIN* had to go back to Aer Lingus to ask for another email demanding that I am due a refund. Aer Lingus have been helpful throughout and have provided countless details and have admitted that they could not operate the flight we were sold by BA.\n\nI am honestly shocked by the way British Airways have handled this. Be very wary of ever purchasing 3rd Party flights via British Airways. They are unable to assist when things go wrong and are offer no help whatsoever.\n\nTo top it off, if you don't get cut off or aren't waiting on hold for ages you get put through to call centre on the other side of the world, where you have to handle poor communication and heavy misunderstanding which is incredibly frustrating and time consuming. I have had to constantly repeat myself and clarify simple details which they just couldn't understand.\n\nThe call centre staff member had the audacity to tell me that she \"Didn't have the time to spend this long on a call\", I clarified to her, that I didn't either and that it shouldn't be this difficult to get a refund for a flight that was not operational.\n\nThe company I work for is international and we use flights regularly to move staff around the world. From this point on, we are no longer using British Airways and they have lost a loyal high spending customer for a worldwide brand.\n\nI now again, await a response from BA and apparently I should get an email within 48 hours with a DECISION on whether we will get a refund. There is no decision needed - we are entitled to our refund! Unbelievable. I am actually astounded that the onus is left on the customer to do this much work.\n\nIf they do not refund us, we will seek a chargeback from the bank as we have all the documentation to back it up that the flight was cancelled and we should be refunded.\n\nDenying refunds should not be made the bigger issue than the initial flight cancellation.\n\n(22/08/24) Update - I was told on the 14th I would get an email in 48 hours. It is now the 22nd, no response from BA so far. Chased them again today by phone. Again, unhelpful response, nobody can give me a straight answer. We will proceed with a chargeback.\n"

I am unable to speak to anyone in person regarding the whereabouts' of our luggage and why it hasn\u2019t been located!\nThe Customer Service shown by BA is absolutely appalling and not acceptable.\nBA are not interested and not communicating with us at all regarding the location of our cases. It is impossible to speak with a human being!\nThe final insult last week, via a BA Chat line: BA advised me to contact the Spanish Baggage Team!! I am staggered by the audacity of it!\n\nBA are responsible for our checked baggage and should assume responsibility for the protection and of locating it.\nWe are totally dissatisfied with BA and the lack of customer service, care and commitment to their passengers; it is disgraceful!\n\nSupporting notes:\nTwo of our suitcases did not arrive at Barcelona airport. This caused severe inconvenience & disruption to our cruise holiday. Plus, lengthy waiting at Barcelona airport in order to register the missing baggage report. Which in turn delayed our embarkation on the ship. Having received emails & text messages from BA advising us they our luggage would be delivered to Palma airport. This was 3 days into the cruise. We then found only the hand luggage case had been delivered to the ship!! Our cruise line concierge on Oceania communicated with BA on our behalf. We were then informed the missing suitcase will arrive in Malta; 6 days into the cruise!\nMy husband only had the clothes he travelled in!! We both only had trainers to wear for 3 days. This resulted in having to shop for clothes, therefore, wasting our valuable holiday time at the ports of call. The missing luggage was never returned to us for the entire duration of our cruise. To date the luggage remains missing. Totally unacceptable!\n"

Employees had no clue what was going on and the only reason I ended up on the plane was because I kept bugging the employees to check my flight. Got into Edinburgh after hours of being at the airport just to find out of the 100+ flyers only six bags had been loaded on the plane and made the journey north from London. I filled out a form and was told the bags should be in tomorrow, so far I have nothing and have been wearing the same clothes almost 72 hours. I have no clue where my luggage is, no clue when it will get here, and still have multiple days left on my trip, or any idea if I\u2019ll be compensated if I have to buy new clothes.

Eventually it gets to Manchester but BA fail to pass our contact details to their courier so they are struggling to deliver it. Avoid."

Despite making several attempts to contact your customer service team and sending multiple emails, I have not received any response or assistance in retrieving my luggage.\nAs you can imagine, the delay of my luggage has caused significant inconvenience and stress during my trip. I had important items in my luggage that I needed for my travel and business purposes. The lack of response from your customer service team only adds to my frustration and disappointment with the entire experience.\nFurthermore, I was extremely disappointed with the behavior of your staff members. I found them to be unprofessional, rude and unhelpful. On several occasions, they hung up on my calls and failed to provide me with any information regarding my delayed luggage.\nWhen I brought this issue to their attention, I was accused of being racist, which is completely unacceptable. I simply compared the service I received from the Indian call center to the service I have received in the UK, and found that the service provided by the Indian call centre staff fell short. In fact, they accused me of being racist. This is offensive and untrue. Let me make myself very clear. I take this allegations incredibly seriously\nI expect British Airways to take responsibility and failing to look at my complaint within a reasonable timeframe and for the delay and provide prompt and satisfactory resolution to this issue. I am also looking for British Airways to take responsibility for compensating me for the inconvenience and stress caused by the delayed luggage and the unprofessional conduct of your staff.\n\nMy advice to anyone who wants to travel with British Airways in the future is to avoid like the plague."

The rudest most useless costumer service I have ever encountered. Booked and paid for seats so myself and my disabled companion could sit together but when doing online check in noticed the seats had been changed and we were separated, as this was not an option for us, I desperately called BA customer services, what a joke! Rude is an understatement, was told they have the right to change seats at any time and there was nothing they could do. I explained we had to sit together, was told to speak to someone at the airport. Again no help. Left standing at the entrance of the plane with a disabled passenger while I had to try and resolve this awful situation. Luckily I asked a passenger if he would move so we could sit together. And this was business class travel!!!! When I complained to BA their response was disgusting and shocking. Let me add it took 5 months for them to respond. Their inclusion and treatment of disabled people needs to be addressed as it is non-existent. I will never fly with BA again and will warn everyone else I know of how rubbish they are. Have also been advised that they are under no legal obligation to compensate us for the distress and suffering we experienced as we did actually fly. What happened to customer service and goodwill.

I subsequently booked parking for T3.\nNearer the time of my flights I happened to check my booking. By accident I noticed that the departure and arrival terminal stated T5. I had received no notification of any terminal change from BA.\nAs this was now nearer my flight time, equivalent parking was significantly more expensive.\nI contacted BA by chat to raise this issue. The agent tried to tell me that the terminal was always due to be T5, until I shared the confirmation email with him. He then insisted that if there had been a terminal change I would have been informed by email inferring that it was my fault. This was categorically not the case.\nI asked for 2 things. firstly to receive compensation for the increased cost of parking and secondly to escalate this issue to ensure all other passengers received notification of the change of terminal so they do not arrive at the wrong terminal for their flights. He tol me he could not help with this and I would have to submit an online complain and sent me a link to do this.\nI duly completed the online form and submitted, only to get a response saying they could not aggress this issue and I need to call customer service.\nI called customer service only to be told to complete the same online form.\nWhen I asked to escalate the issue to someone who could help me, the agent disconnected the call.\nBA are clearly no longer interested in providing any level of customer service.

The onboard staff were very apologetic, even the Captain could not believe what had been said, the senior stewardess sent an email, which I saw, to the service management, I was told someone would contact me, well guess what, 8 weeks later, and despite trying to speak to someone- NOTHING!!!!!- So I eventually called the help desk number, after waiting for over an hour, I was shocked when he said, \" you have to appreciate, we get THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS EVERY DAY' it will take time- BA, you have a serious problem.

Arrived at the airport, flight delayed by an hour. OK it happens. Finally boarded, the pilot sounding pretty p'd off as he announced the reason for the delay was ba had the plane sitting at the wrong terminal at Heathrow since the previous evening and nobody had noticed. Landed an hour late. Nobody had told the ground crews so there was no stand for the plane. Eventually out of the airport an hour and a half later than the expected arrival, having missed all the trains I had valid ticket for so a 2 hour wait for a coach to get home which will be sometime around 3am. Oh and they've slashed the onboard tea and coffee. You get a bottle of water and junk food snack.

Another company really needs to set up a good alternative to Avios Points where you can save up your points and pay for your flights as Avios isn\u2019t as generous as Airmiles used to be anyway.

Also the last agent that I spoke to claimed not to have any access to email and he also denied being able to see the entries that I can see on my Avios statement and so he\u2019s obviously a liar too!

As I was seated next to my gate and the boarding was about to begin, an agent of the company who's badge stated \u2018customer experience\u2019 came up to my girlfriend and me and asked for my ticket\u2019s group number (it was almost at the end of the aircraft, number 8). I will not disclose their name to avoid a lawsuit, but I will mention that the flight was to Aberdeen on the 15th of May 2023 at 21:00, flight number BA1318, gate A6. Then they did not inform nor advise with an apology but, by their tone, commanded that my cabin bags are to be put in the hoard as the plane was full AT NO EXTRA CHARGE?! Blimey, thank you very much for not making me pay you even more for this; let\u2019s face it, scam. They then proceeded to passengers sitting next to me, enquiring the same question, the latter was in group 3, business class, and the agent told them their bags were safe. What kind of class shovenism is this?! In the 21st century?! I understand business class has its privileges and all; the website says they get a separate seat and an extra bag allowance. Nonetheless, it does not state that in case of a plane being fully booked, business class passengers will be treated with respect while everyone else will be treated as sloppy second peasants who were lucky enough that BA gave them an honour to get a plane at all and soil its interior with their poverty...for a low price of 300+ pounds. My money is as good as theirs; I could fly with EasyJet if I did not care for cabin luggage, but I chose BA because I thought my bag would be with me in the cabin. Moreover, with this money, I could have flown with EeasyJet and saved some extra. I mean, yes, people carry their laptops in cabin bags, but some carry fragile cargo; what if I had a set of porcelain gifted to me by my late grandmother? What then? We all know loaders do not care about the state of luggage, so every fragile item carried by my fellow passengers could have been destroyed. Overall profoundly disappointed in the company and customer service; the current BA is a disgrace to what it used to be and is heading towards a terrible future as a company. Of course, I understand this review will lead nowhere as the big people in charge of the Airline could not care less about the troubles of mere mortals, and there is no action for us to take here. Still, I urge you, the reader, to avoid the company if other options are available."

Our trip was not far, only to Milan. They keep sending us flight was on schedule until last minute the flight was cancelled. Knowing not everyone lives in London, they redirected us to Gatwick next day, which not gangrenated would take off either. Not a single customer person to deal with the issue. By this point we paid car parking and it was not refundable once we in. Too much to loose if next day flight not going to take off so we cancelled the flight and drove home. There were many flights were not cancelled but I guess our flight was just not full enough so they chose us to cancel? It was very stressful to deal with hotel, tourist attraction ticketing cancellations. After all, we have been contacted BA filled the foams, waited several months before they got back to us. Answer was : ''not under their control. ''emmm...so not met their compensation claim''. So many months later, we still out of pocket and it was worst experience with them ever. ... BA can say pandemic caused everything, but there were many countries did much better job than us during that time. For example Italy. Ask if I'd still travel with them?

Three weeks before they were due to fly my father passed away, resulting in myself flying to the UK for the funeral and to be with my family.\n\nMy wife requested a refund on the ticket given a family bereavement meant that I would not be at home in South Florida to be part of the surprise birthday visit.\n\nBritish Airways denied this request, as my friends are not related to my father. BA decided that it was best for them to keep the money for the tickets, despite me having to pay for another ticket for myself to fly to the UK.\n\nProfits come before Sympathy or Empathy at BRITISH AIRWAYS"

    "reviewDescription": "I have never experienced anything worse when it comes to airlines unfortunately. I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled. This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc. As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for \u00a3250 in total (London prices). I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back and that the phone call is recorded. My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later. I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money.\nI never received the money back for the hotel, compensation for cancelled flight 1, compensation for cancelled flight 2, the extra food I had to pay for, the uber, or just the actual cost of the flight.\nI was first transferred 3\u20ac (!!) by British Airways and told that they can't listen to the recording. They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was \"weather conditions\" although all other non-BA flights were going... I lost over \u00a3700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either. It just really feels like they don't care about people.\nWorst service/airline ever."

    "reviewDescription": "Our BA flight from Newcastle to London Heathrow was delayed almost 2 hours. Despite supplying email addresses when booking, we did not receive any notification of the delay. We eventually arrive at Heathrow T5 to be delayed a further 20+ minutes leaving the aircraft due to not enough staff to handle the walk way. What has happened to BA and Heathrow to provide such poor service now. The time it has taken us to reach Paddington with BA is the same time it would have taken us to Drive. Never again BA."

    "reviewDescription": "Flew from Terminal 5 6 May to Tokyo. The most stressful check in every experienced. At bag drop 6 check ins were not working and it took nearly an hour to complete. Food on outward journey just ok. Return flight landing 27 May had upgraded to premier never none such a waste of money. My friend had the beef, as had beef on outward flight, it was just grizzle and inedible. I had the vegetarian which was swimming in grease. BA have certainly dropped their standards and would be very reluctant to have to travel with them again."

    "reviewDescription": "Trip to Canada booked via travel agent as multi centred. They booked BA flights travelling in premium. Told at the time of booking seats cannot be confirmed until 24 hours before when you check in. 3 weeks to go travel company issue us with our ticket numbers. BA app now says we can pay to secure our seats. We decided to do this. An extra \u00a3138in total for seats on return flight. Outbound flight cannot secure seats together as there is only limited seats available to us. The other seats (which we said we would pay for just to resolve this) are for direct booking customers. As non direct bookers we do not get this option, despite having flights booked since November last year.\nMultiple calls to BA customer service which appears to based in South Africa. Told us it\u2019s the airport responsible to resolve this!!!! Given a contact number for Heathrow which when I called was told this number was an internal telephone number for BA staff only. Staff member I spoke to very worried I had been given this. There are still other seats available but not to non direct bookers despite the fact we have no doubt paid the same, if not more for our flights. Only option is to pay \u00a392 to sit roughly 6 roles apart."

    "reviewDescription": "Absolutely disgusted!\nI selected economy plus so i could have flexibility in changing my flight times with no change fee. (original flight and return cost me \u00a3191)\nI rang BA yesterday morning to enquire about changing my return flight by 5 hours earlier. I was told it would be \u00a343.00 to change. I was disappointed it cost but agreed to pay that amount. When i checked my bank account later i realised \u00a3340.00!!! had been taken out. I rang the refunds department said i was told it was \u00a343.40 i even wrote this down at the time on the phone, the lines are very dodgy and the lady on the phone had a very strong accent, she even misheard me reading my card number numerous times the line was awful. They showed me no symptathy said i agreed to it i gave my card details and that its their word against mine and that they will listen to my original call and contact me. I got a call back today saying i agreed to \u00a3343 and theres nothing they can do. I explained they wouldnt hear what i heard and that the lines are awful. I was only told the price once if the lady repeated it again later on i might have cottoned on that that was not what i heard.\nMy original booking cost \u00a3191.00 and ontop of that \u00a3340 has been taken just to change my flight a few hours earlier. No one would have agreed to that price its disgusting. I am a student and cant afford it! Again no sympathy or understanding, theres nothing they can do i have to fill in a complaint via customer relations and wait 4-6 weeks. First time flying with them, i never will again. Down \u00a3340 just because I called them for help, wish i never did!"

    "reviewDescription": "Flight was cancelled late evening the night before we were due to fly. Both numbers on the cancellation notice went to a recorded message stating they were only open office hours. No explanation given apart from 'operational constraints'. This is the second time this has happened with BA. The delay was very inconvenient and stressful. You can only claim compensation by making a complaint but they settled quickly for our extra night in the hotel.\nIt seems BA would rather pay compensation that actually run flights. This is a completely unreliable service.\n"

    "reviewDescription": "Update on my BA flight from Nice To London: we were taken to a hotel last night at around 19.15/19.30 as we were told they were no seats available on next flights and that we should expect a message from BA . In the meantime BA updated the manage my booking an put us on the 20.10 pm flight whilst we were going to the hotel. Then they changed it a 5am for some of us to today\u2019s flight at 13.35 but I was not on the list . Contacted them via the chat and after going through many checks I was told \u201cyou did not turn up for the flight at 20.10 the previous night , can\u2019t help you . This is despite the fact that I explained that around that time we were being taken to the hotel booked by for us by BA. The woman would not listen. Back inside the airport in Nice where I saw a member of staff who organised the hotel the previous night , explained the situation again. She was well aware and assured that BA had all the info and we should have been booked on the 20.10 the night before but for the following morning . At the end she took it on her and managed to get me a boarding pass for today at 13.35. BA your are a total disgrace and tomorrow I will write to the CEO.\n\n11/10/2022\nStill no response from the CEO.\nReceived a \u00a350 voucher today (I am refusing it)\nThe Law is clear its 250\u20ac compensation in my case.\nSo, BA provides below average service and does not respect the laws.\nI will follow the complaints process, but I am\nLooking forward to the day when I will file a CCJ."

Plenty of phone calls, emails and DMs with BA saying that the problem will be solved in 7-10 days. Well, still waiting.... and these days have long passed.

    "reviewDescription": "It\u2019s a cliche but I only give one star in order to be eligible to leave a review. BA, ourr national carrier, used to stand for quality. Now it\u2019s synonymous with quality - very poor quality. BA cancelled our return flight from Valencia in June when we\u2019d only just landed a few hours before in Spain at the start of our break. Despite non existent customer service I managed, after several hours trying on unanswered phone lines or recorded messages that just hung up on me, to get a flight back to LHR via a web chat, but we had to go via Mallorca first!! Ok, the cancellation may not have been BA\u2019s fault but the diabolical, disdainful and disinterested attitude of BA Customer Services and their lack of interest in dealing with my claim is squarely on them. I submitted a compensation claim at the end of June, and received one email acknowledgment. Since then i have had three \u201cwe\u2019re on the case\u201d emails but nothing else. When I eventually managed to get hold of a BA human being on the phone yesterday he said it was nothing to do with him and his section and would do nothing to help me. I will never willingly give my hard earned cash to BA and their like again. They have forgotten that their shareholders only make money if mugs like me continue to fly with them. They won\u2019t mug me again."

    "reviewDescription": "I thought that I had to deal with a prestigious company. Instead, they charged me probably another ticket or something that I never booked, and I only realized that when I went to use my debit card and found it empty! Not only empty but also they caused me an overdraft..\nI called the company and they didn't explain anything, except that the money would be refound after two weeks! I called my bank fraud and security service and they helped me get the money back in two working days -actually, this will hopefully be the day after tomorrow, and I have to use my credit card till then.\nThat was a great disappointment -I will never use British Airways again. I never had such issue with smaller companies. If someone gets money from my card without my will, I'd call it stealing. Yet, BA and my bank seemed to have a way to get the money without asking me -something that is not allowed to happen in any other purchases, the bank is always asking for my confirmation first. And no one explained to me why -just that this happens when you book from BA online.\nBA was willing to give a money refound after two weeks.. well what kind of refound can heal my embarrassment when I had to leave my shpping basket, cos my card was empty? Who can reasure me that they won't get money from my account again? How can I feel safe now that they have my (basically my partner's) bank details?\nI feel upset and scared at the moment, and it's unbelievable, cos I was always looking up for this company.."

    "reviewDescription": "BA change my flight and give me a 5 hour connection at DFW. There is a more convenient flight, but I can't change to that flight on-line. So, I call BA - a 30 minute wait and then the usual long security (when I was already logged in an had to provide my password, flight PIN, etc). The call centre woman has to consult a colleague about my request and comes back with a charge of \u00a3300 for me making the change plus the difference in the price of the flight (which she couldn' tell me).\nSo, BA changes my flight and wants me to pay for a reasonable connection. BA are insulting - and a rip-off."

    "reviewDescription": "Flew with BA to Orlando in April 2023. What can I say, great customer service, very friendly and helpful. Uploaded our covid passes onto website two days before, very simple, checked in on the app the day before, also very simple, checked our bags into Gatwick the night before at the desk, very simple (surely this cant last). Walked thru security and gates were called an hour before, fast boarding process and we were seated easily. legroom not bad for economy, I am 6 foot 2 and it was fine. Air crew were lovely, the food wasnt bad (we bought a meal deal just in case, wasnt necessary in hindsight) Entertainment was good on plane and flight was slightly late taking off but made good time. Return flights just as good. Thanks BA we will use you again :)"

    "reviewDescription": "It is so sad to see BA go through such a shambles. As a loyal (gold) customer I have always been so supportive and through the entire pandemic just racked up more and more vouchers. Now with multiple issues with multiple flight bookings I cannot even get in contact with anyone to explore options to resolve so I guess ironically due to this inability to manage, I assume too many customer service requests, lets assume accidentally, BA will probably just end up keeping my money"
