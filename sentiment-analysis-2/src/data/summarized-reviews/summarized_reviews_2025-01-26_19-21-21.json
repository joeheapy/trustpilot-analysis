    "reviewTitle": "BA YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES",
    "reviewDescription": "We flew from Edinburgh to London Heathrow and connected from London Heathrow to Rome. Got on the plane at Edinburgh and two people decided that they didn’t want to fly. Delayed whilst they got their cases off. The conveyor belt broke down whilst they were doing this. Waited on an engineer coming eventually arrived fixed that we missed our slot. Eventually arrived into Heathrow and met at the gate given a ticket to say our next flight was at 7pm given a £10 meal voucher with a 7 hour delay ahead of us, wouldn’t even buy you a sandwich and a drink. Told to go to customer services. There was an earlier flight at 2pm ish we asked if we couldn’t get on? My son looked on line and we could buy 4 tickets on that flight despite being told there was no seats and showing the lady the flights on his phone. Told we should go to the gate at that time and they would see what they could do, we never got on. Our original flight from Edinburgh was 8.05 arrive London Heathrow 9.35 leave Heathrow 11.50 arrive Rome 15.25. So over two hours between flights. This happened on the 21st June, they did eventually after several emails back and forth with my son who claimed for 4 of us. They admitted they were liable for compensation this was 11th January 2025 and asked for my sons bank details. He sent them and reminded them that there was 4 of us. They then emailed back to say they weren’t paying compensation we had plenty of time to catch our flight and all they would pay was the extra taxi fare we had to get. It was after midnight when we eventually arrived in Rome. To say BA are one of the best airlines to travel with and this is the shoddy treatment we have received is beyond me. You can’t speak to anyone, I think nearly an 8 month wait is unreasonable and BA should be ashamed of themselves. I personally think your just going to get fed up and go away!! Well I can tell you BA we are NOT going away and we will continue to fight for what we are owed.",

    "reviewSummary": "The review recounts a frustrating travel experience from Edinburgh to Rome via London Heathrow with British Airways, including delays due to passengers and a broken conveyor belt, a tedious 7-hour layover with insufficient meal vouchers, difficulty rebooking on an earlier flight, and a lengthy and ultimately unsatisfactory compensation process from the airline."

I was told I could no longer have the seats, they didn’t explain why just put me into a regular seat with poor legroom, I was informed that I could claim my money back once I had returned to the UK.\n\nI put in my claim when I returned in October 2024, and received an email giving me a case number and telling me that it will be dealt with as soon as possible. I have now been waiting almost 3 months for my money back, I’ve contacted them on numerous occasions only to be told that it’s in a queue And that I can’t speak to the relevant department who deals with this. Today, I tried using the chat line who couldn’t understand a word I was saying as it’s obviously a robot.

    "reviewTitle": "British Airways happy to 'steal' from customers! Appalling treatment!",
    "reviewDescription": "I am appalled at the despicable way in which British Airways have behaved! I am absolutely angry, upset, frustrated and fed up with the seeming impossibility and inability of BA staff to arrange for me to book a seat for a cello alongside a passenger! They have effectively stolen £76 from me and are refusing to refund this! I have been waiting to be contacted by a manager, since mid- November and have now given up, hence posting this review!\nBA's procedure for booking a cello seat is TOTALLY RIDICULOUS and near impossible:\nOn 13th November 2024 I called BA to book a seat for my son and a seat for his cello, to travel from UK to Austria. I have booked seats twice before with BA and know from these experiences that rather than simply booking two seats online (as with any other airline he has travelled with!) that BA require that a cello seat has to be booked separately to the passenger seat, via a phone call.\nWhen I called to book a seat for the cello, I was first told I could simply book 2 seats via the BA website. I was very surprised and asked the staff member if this was correct. I was told this was the case, and felt relieved that BA must have changed their rules. However I decided to check...... I googled BA’s website and discovered that this information was in fact incorrect. When I mentioned this, the staff member first disagreed...and then checked.. and told me that I did in fact need to book the cello seat on the phone!! It was very surprising that this person did not know the rules and had I not known this from previous experience, I would have bought an incorrect ticket which apparently would not have been accepted at the airport!\nI was then told I needed to book a seat for my son first, and that once I had a reference number, to call back to arrange for a seat for the cello. I did this and I used a BA voucher to pay for the flight for my son: Booking JRQEJZ.\nWhen I called back to ask for the additional seat, I was told that a form had to first be submitted to apply for the seat. I made it very clear that we definitely needed a seat for the cello as it was not allowed legally, for this cello to be placed in the hold. The staff member then said they had submitted the form and that I would be contacted by email a day or two later, and should at that point call back to pay for the seat.\nTwo days later, on 15th Nov I received and email asking me to contact BA about my booking. I called back only to be told that the form had somehow not been properly submitted and needed to be submitted again, I was again told to call back 24 to 48 hours later. I called again on 16th and was told there was still no decision about the cello seat and that I should call again in 24-72 hours. My son was due to fly in LESS than 72 hours and this felt like an impossible situation!!!!\nThe staff members that I spoke to did not seem at all sympathetic, caring, or even concerned that I had spent four days, not to mention many, many hours of being on hold, that I was getting nowhere and still did not know if the seat would be granted or not!! Their entire attitude was as if they didn’t care at all about their customers!!\nAgain, I called back a day later – 17th Nov in the evening and at that point was told that my son could not have a seat for the cello but would have to book it into the hold, despite me having expressly stated that this was not safe for an old cello and also was not legally allowed for his instrument to go in the hold!!! I stated that I knew it was possible to take the cello on a seat, as we had done this on two previous occasions without problem, however, I was simply repeatedly told that cellos cannot go on seats and must go into the hold. If this is the case, why was I not told this? It makes no sense, as on BA’s website it states:\n“Your cello can travel next to you in the cabin in an additional seat. You’ll need to buy this seat specifically for your cello when you book your flight, or at least 48 hours before you travel, subject to availability.\nAt this point, I had only a few hours to find a new flight for my son and his cello, in order that he could return on 18th. I was also in the position of having purchased a seat for my son for £76, which I ONLY purchased because I was told by BA staff that in order to apply for a cello seat, I HAD TO 1ST PURCHASE A SEAT and obtain a booking reference number!!! I would never have purchased this seat if I had known from the start that they were to refuse the cello!!! When I asked for this cost to be refunded I was repeatedly told that this was not possible! I consider this akin to stealing this money from me!! I then spoke with Swalia, a manager who said she would look into this for me and contact me. I am still waiting and have heard nothing. I am beyond upset and consider that BA not only do not care about their customers, but are happy to steal from them!\nThey obviously do not want to have musicians travel with them.\nAvoid at all costs!",

    "reviewDescription": "What a joke of a company. Talk about destroying what was once a major UK brand to be proud of. Don't know where to start.... let's start at the beginning, their website when trying to book. Glitches and crashes constantly, and repeatedly asking for the same information. Customer Service is another pathetic offering. I've been unable to change a return flight online, can't do it through chat, and via the telephone number for the past 3 days I get 'we're taking large volumes of calls at the moment so please try again later' 3 days!!!!. The value of Avios points have diminished over the years are becoming worthless now, and often unusable. In flight experience isn't much better, with poor staff attitude, forcing passengers to line up for boarding the plane isn't ready to boarding, just to meet timing quotas, smaller legroom in economy than some of the budget airlines, and European business class, no more than a free middle seat, and a drink and a rather tasteless lunch offering. Sean Doyle the CEO, you should hang your head in shame. Maybe take sometime looking at your competitors such as Virgin, Qatar and Emirates, who clearly know how to deliver world class service and treat their customers with dignaty and respect. BA's decline started over 20 odd years ago and continues to this day. Get back to basics, start with investing in customer service, stop gouging for every penny, recreate loyalty. You're lucky you have the Heathrow slots, otherwise you'd be destroyed by the competition.\n\nFollow up note the day after the review above - BA website and customer service centre down today...'\"call back in 2 hours and maybe it will be sorted\"... gets better!!!!!",

I called BA who said someone had changed the email address, they would freeze the account and come back to me in 2 weeks. 2 weeks later I called for progress to find they wouldn’t talk to me as wrong email address after over 1 hour of arguing they believed me. Said the previous agent should have changed the email address so would send me a link and it would take 72 hours to change! I questioned the hackers having access to my account and they said as 2 factor authentication no problem. I asked them for the mobile number on the account and the hackers had changed that too. I managed to change the email address back and then received an email with an email trail from Jonathan on 9/12/24 where he had emailed the hackers saying there was suspicious activity on the account and airmiles had been stolen. So BA had emailed the hackers where they still had access to my account! I chased this, pointed this out and asked for an investigation to the data breach only to receive an email to say my airmiles had been reinstated and case closed! I’ve called 3 times to be told I need to speak to Newcastle but everytime I call I get put through to India and there is no number for Newcastle so I’m told to raise a complaint online. I’ve filled out a case complaint 3 times and no one has come back to me. Serious data breach, I’ve had to book the flights I wanted with to book with my airmiles paying cash with another airline as by the time they sorted the issue they said would take 2 weeks ended up taking 6 weeks so the flights were gone.

I’ve spent over 70 days arguing and proving to BA that the flight was cancelled but due to the special way that BA control the customer complaints department, you can’t speak to the person or department dealing with it.

    "reviewDescription": "Flying back from Schipol in The Netherlands to London City. I got to the airport a few hours early, went to the BA check-in desk, and asked if I could change to one of the two flights before the one I am booked on, and how much would it cost to switch. Same departure and arrival airports. I was told that couldn't even look into that for me, and I needed to call a BA customer service number. When did airlines decide that you couldn't even discuss the simplest of changes to travel plans in person at the airport? So, I called BA, eventually got through to an agent, explained what I was looking to do and asked for the the price to change. After a few minutes checking he told me that yes, I could switch to the earliest available flight. As he didn't tell me how much I assumed it would be free, or a minimal charge. After another five minutes he had successfully moved me to the earliest flight, then informed me it would cost £139, which is essentially the cost of buying a new ticket. Memo to BA - as part of your customer service training, if there is such a thing, have the agents inform the passenger of any price implications before changing the booking, not after. I said I didn't want to proceed at that cost, he told me he had in the meantime removed me from my original flight, so I would have to re-check in at the airport desk. I went back to the desk, and was told my entire booking had been cancelled, and that I was \"no longer travelling\". After I expressed my disappointment at that particular nugget of information, a supervisor came over and eventually I was back to where I started, with a ticket for my original flight. Only half an hour of my time wasted, with some unnecessary annoyance. I subsequently went to the boarding gate to see if I could be allowed on one of the earlier flights, and was told this was \"not possible\". I am quite sure it is possible, BA just actively hates their customers, and rather than allowing for a simple accommodation, that would inconvenience literally no one, and would mean I got home to my family two hours early, they chose to say no.

The seats hardly recline and are more uncomfortable when reclined but the worst part is the seat itself, no padding at all, I suffer from sciatica but even my husband who does not found the seats impossible they were so hard with no padding. This is not acceptable on such a long flight. I was in agony on both flights. The cabin was so warm and on this plane those adjustable tiny fans above your head do not exist. The food too was horrible, pasta with tomato sauce only! The worst bit however was the return flight, we landed (with numerous excuses from the captain about a fault on the plane which personally I find scary) only to be left sitting on the boiling hot plane for a further 1.5 hours because there were no bus drivers to take us from the plane to the terminal.

It's so low, the kind of low you see for scam websites.\n\nMy first and last experience is due to the fact that they cancelled our flights that were due to depart on Boxing Day. They gave us no alternative carriers that we could fly with. I had to get a refund and fly with a different operator. With it being so much closer to Christmas we had to pay £2000 extra for our flights.\n\nI started a complaint with BA but have been effectively ignored. Completed ghosted. I shall be complaining externally about this terrible organisation but either way, I'll never travel with them again. I hope they go bust.",

The next flight was delayed by over 6 hours with no communication from BA whatsover. The above was only a small part of the problem and can be excused slightly as the weather was to blame.\nHowever, it was our arrival at the hotel and our treatment that I was shocked and dismayed about.\nDue to the delay, we didn't arrive at the hotel until 1am\nWe were told that our whole booking had been cancelled by BA.\nEventually, after paying 690 euros, we were given a tiny noisy room for 1 night and made aware that under no uncertain terms would there be a room available for the rest of the holiday.\nNext morning, after multiple phone calls to BA, we were found a large sea view room, which we had already paid for and lost 2 nights in.\nI requested BA refund for these 2 nights but was gobsmacked to be told - No -\nThey refused further discussion on the matter and to my horror I have since found out they are not ABTA protected.\nIn fact they have no resolution solutions at all. They are a law unto themselves.\nBuyer beware - all is great until there's a hiccup when they will reveal themselves to be the most vicious, money grabbing and uncaring travel company you will ever come across. Do not book unless you can afford to lose a lot of money.\n",

    "reviewDescription": "This started with an email stating that my return flight from Barbados had been cancelled. No explanation and no offer of help. The advice was just check their website to rebook or claim a refund. Three weeks before I was supposed to fly out, a refund was of no use due to expensive accommodation bookings. The only flight on offer was 24 hours later. When rebooking, they even made me pay for seat selection again when I had already done this on the original booking. This was later refunded.\nOn my return home I lodged a claim for reimbursement of additional expenses, hotel. food and taxis but the website is not easy to navigate to find out what they pay and how to lodge the claim.\n10 weeks later the status of the claim is simply ''received'' in other words no-one has progressed the claim. 10 weeks of inaction.\nGeneral customer service cannot access the claims process, all they say is that the team are very busy. They cannot provide a contact number to speak to the team so the customer is left entirely frustrated at the complete lack of customer service and accountability.\nLike some of the other contributers, I think I have made my last booking with BA.\n",

    "reviewDescription": "Dear OWNERS of British Airlines\n\nI am writing to express my concerns regarding a recent experience with British Airways that I found to be quite disappointing.\n\nFlight BA 0552 of January 12, 2025\n\nIn my experience, the level of service provided was far below what one would expect from a reputable airline. Specifically, I encountered a significant delay during BA0552 flight, which was exacerbated by a lengthy crew replacement process that took two hours, followed by an additional 1.5 hours for flight attendant replacement.\n\nThroughout this ordeal, I found the staff to be unhelpful and, at times, rude. There was a notable lack of clear and honest communication regarding the reasons for the delay, leaving passengers feeling frustrated and uninformed.\n\nGiven these experiences, I regret to say that I no longer view British Airways as a premium airline. Instead, I perceive it to be more akin to a budget carrier in terms of service quality.\n\nI recommend that potential passengers consider using your airline only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nI would like particularly like to highlight the behaviour of Chief Flight Attendants MR. INCOGNITO who was especially rude and dismissive towards to passengers!\n\nI hope you take this feedback into consideration as you strive to improve your services.\nPassenger Seat 2A\n",

    "reviewDescription": "I want to understand why I can’t rate the as 0. 1 is a huge overrating for this clown company. I was a gold card holder 7 years ago and would only fly BA. Last year they cancelled my return flight whilst on holiday with my whole family with 10 days notice. 6 months later they have just declined our compensation as we had to pay our £2000 for replacement flights, extra nights accommodation, extra day car hire. Their reason: they cancelled the flight for ‘Commercial Reasons’!!!!! So why do I foot the bill for their commercial issues?!?!?! These clowns may think I will leave it here but rest assured I will take this to ombudsman followed by legal firms AND I will be claiming every single penny I am entitled too. I really hope that at some point a Class Action is brought against BA as you can read thousands of similar experiences online and they seem to get away with their inept customer service and ability to stress customers for 6-12 months as I can ill afford £2000 on top of my holiday cost for reasons that an airline simply cancelled my flight and provided no alternative leaving me to book a replacement. The final point of note was that I booked a Vueling flight (which they told me they could not transfer me too as they had no agreement with the airline) AND wait for it, the payment on my statement for that flight went to BRITISH AIRWAYS!!!!!!!!!! 🤡",

I asked for a drink and he said yes he will bring it, waited and waited after 20 minutes asked again from another cabin crew and also was told they will bring it, the flight ended and had still did not get my drink. I was very disappointed. This was my first time flying with British airways have never used him before and I fly at least 5 times a year for both business and lesure. Hope this was a once off and that this was just a bad day for the crew.\nThe food is really horrible especially after spending £1800 on a flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg i expected better much better for an airlines as big as British airways. The dinner i opened had a look and closed it straight away, went hungry and looked forward to breakfast. Then recieved the breakfast and did the same opened and closed it not good at all. A least i managed to eat the fruit.\nThe seat space is really uncomfortable, with theatre table beant the trays were sliding off.\nNot sure if anyone will call me the after care service normally never happens. My flight number was BA57 on 2nd January 2025.\n\nI am flying tonight again 12th January 2025 BA 56 hope his will be different after trying to upgrade my seat to a window seat and not able to, get to the end and dies not allowed me to make a payment and the seat was available.

We were given a flight 7 hours later with separate middle seats, far apart from each other but this had a knock on effect of missing our hotel stay and car and driver that had been arranged in India.\nI was going to India for my wedding and missed my wedding dress fitting appointment also.\nWe were very upset and thought we would get a cup of tea as we both had headaches from the waiting and commotion but the queue at the cafe was so long that we decided to go to the BA lounge to sit down. I was feeling very dizzy and nauseated. My partner said to the receptionist called Av that if he could get the manager while we settle down.\nAv asked us for the tickets and then mocked us seeing the ‘economy class’ which was given to us as the only option by BA. I can’t express my disgust at the way he smirked and let out a laugh seeing the tickets. When I confronted him, he asked me for further details which I did provide and added the issues I was facing due to a pounding headache to which his response was “are you going to answer me straight forward or not?”. He threatened to take us off the flight several times if we didn’t move.\nWe both collapsed on the floor near the door due to being drained of all this and bad head ache.\nThe manager Caroline Sawyer came and announced straight away that we should get up and leave ignoring our condition. They didn’t ask us once about our health, they didn’t care about spoiling my onward wedding plans which had to be all rearranged, they didn’t care at all about spoiling my start of the beautiful journey for my destination wedding.\nInfact she threatened us to call the police and have us removed from the flight again and report at the gate to be monitored.\nWe left and went for a tea and sandwich. They had given us a voucher of £10 each. The cost of two tea and one sandwich and two packets of crips came to £20.95.\nAlthough we were going to wait 7hours, they didn’t provide us water or any other comfort.\nBecause they only have a relationship with virgin Atlantic and air Canada. They would not put us on an afternoon flight on air India even though it was available.\nI wish I had not made this mistake of booking BA for my big day plan.\nIt’s humiliating and embarrassing even to talk to them. They talk to you as if they are God and we are peasants.

When that happens, what is important is how the airline’s customer services treat you. In this regard I’ve been both shocked and appalled by BA’s response.\nAfter trying 23 times over several days to contact BA Customer Services when I was repeatedly cut off by BA due them having a ‘high call volume’, I finally managed to speak to someone. The response I received was unbelievable.\nI asked about the status of my claim and why BA had not communicated anything to me and why BA had automatically closed my claim when I later checked the BA app. I was told “sorry I can’t help you, that department is not operational at the moment”. When I asked when it would be operational and how long it would take to process my claim, I was informed “someone from that department should contact you in the next 2 to 3 months”. Not days, not weeks, months!\nWhen making a booking with BA they require immediate payment, when BA owes the customer money they take 3 months.

I called BA who told me there were no other flights available on 13/05 from Istanbul to Heathrow; I was told there were no BA flights at all on that day. I therefore cancelled the entire booking.\n\nI have since discovered the BA representative who told me there were no alternative flights available was incorrect. There are THREE BA flights on 13/05/25. One leaves just thirty minutes later than our original flight time. Re-booking this new flight would cost significantly more than I originally paid.\n\nI therefore called customer services, and asked that my booking be reinstated, on the new flight, at the original price. The representative told me that they could not assist me because my booking was cancelled. However - I only cancelled the entire booking due to the false information I was given in BA's cancellation email, and in the subsequent phone call with BA.\nBA customer services advised me to raise a written complaint via their website. I did this on 5/12/24, a month ago. I received an online acknowledgement (with a reference number) which said that my complaint would be investigated thoroughly and someone would be back in touch with me as soon as possible.\nI never heard another thing. So I have had to book flights with an alternative carrier, and I have learned the hard way that BA is no longer 'the airline of choice'.\nI won't trust them in future - they don't seem to know what they are doing and can't even be bothered to respond to a written complaint.",

    "reviewTitle": "A NIGHTMARE FOR OUR FAMILY!!!",
    "reviewDescription": "Our recent experience with British Airways was beyond disappointing—it was infuriating, exhausting, and completely unacceptable. We were traveling as a family of six, including an 8-year-old child, with 10 pieces of luggage, and a daughter with a health condition that made this ordeal even harder to endure. What was supposed to be a straightforward journey from Prague to Los Angeles turned into a multi-day disaster.\n\nFirst, our flight from Prague to London was delayed by 10 hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight to Los Angeles. Instead of finding a reasonable solution, British Airways rescheduled us with a 48-hour layover in London. We were forced to endure an unnecessary two-day stay, and what made it worse was the complete lack of empathy or effort from the airline staff at Heathrow. Frankly, they did not care about our situation, offered no genuine assistance, and left us feeling abandoned in an already stressful situation. There wasn't even a live agent available at the airport and we had to wait in a long line to call and talk to someone. It is important to mention that there were earlier flights available that were leaving with empty seats in higher class cabins, but the airline refused to give us those seats.\n\nWhen we were finally sent to an airport hotel, things didn’t improve. After traveling for hours with a child, we arrived only to find that our room wasn’t ready for multiple hours, forcing us to sit in the lobby, hungry, tired, and with nowhere to rest or work. To make matters worse, we were all missing work and had to keep up with remote responsibilities in a completely unsuitable environment. Despite our repeated requests for help, no one at the hotel or British Airways was willing to assist us, leaving us feeling ignored and helpless. The hotel vouchers they gave us were for only 1 night and whem we told them that our flight is 2 days after, they said that we need to go back to the airport the next day to get new vouchers and there is no guarantee that it will be the same hotel...\n\nOn top of everything, the hotel was over an hour’s drive from the city center, meaning we couldn’t even make the best of this awful layover by exploring the city. Instead, we were stuck far from everything, with no options other than waiting around miserably until our next flight.\n\nBritish Airways showed zero regard for our time, comfort, or well-being, and this experience was nothing short of a nightmare for our entire family. It’s one thing to encounter delays, but the lack of basic customer service and accountability we faced is completely inexcusable. I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with British Airways to think twice—no one deserves to go through what we did.\n\nWe expect a formal response and adequate compensation for the enormous inconvenience and distress caused by this ordeal. Anything less would only add to the disappointment we already feel.",

Was on hold with BA for over 2 hours and 12 minutes with nobody picking up. We had to rebook for $3108 and submitted a complaint thinking similar to other overbooking with other airlines we would be refunded. They pointed out in T&Cs they are only obligated to refund 100 GBP per ticket for inconveniences. Basically, lost $1559 ticket plus another $3108 ticket purchased and found out they resold/oversold our ticket for 2999 GBP. I am upset my grandmother's death was an inconvenience to your company and that the agent who wrote the response to our claim was annoyed that BA only made $1559 plus 2999 GBP on the seat that was probably sold to some desperate or rich person that didn't have a funeral to go to an likely a nice holiday, who knows. I feel if you buy a ticket, you buy a ticket. Should I be stupid enough to not show, BA is still compensated for the seat because it was paid for.

Her arm suffered major inflammation - I can attach a photo if customers wish to PM me. The area was clearly severely infested. No action taken.\n\nAfter two hours my son who was sitting next to her had his whole back inflamed with severe red rashes and excessive itching from the bug bites on the seat. Cristina took several photos, which BA have not released to me. She gave them anti histamines and after few hours gave more antihistamines (dosage authorised by the captain / doctor?). The infestation was now clearly pervasive.\n\nAfter several hours (!!!) she finally moved my son to an aisle seat in premium economy and moved my wife into in a middle seat away from him and which was rather uncomfortable. My wife experienced breathing issues , which means this represented a serious threat to my and my family's safety as she was traveling with 2 minors alone.\n\nThese were all recorded by BA and Cristina assured that the complaint would be lodged and someone from BA would contact.
